          April Fool.
          The origin or "April Fool" ia as remote
          aod as impossible to determine as the birth?
          day of the first fool who marred Nature's
          original design of intellectual Man. We
          trace it everywhere; but the Beeret hour of
          its birth ba files research. We are forced to
          admit its existence, without being able to
          assign a cause. The Romans undoubtedly
          enjoyed its questionable fun. They cer?
          tainly carried its memory in all their con?
          quests. Its observance was long cherished
          among numer?os nations. Abandoned to
          the yalgar in our self-elected age of extreme
          refinement, Momus seems to revenge him?
          self by selecting the most elevated and dig?
          nified objects for bis practical jokes. Nor
          man, cor nation, nor things visible, nor
          things invisible can elude bis satire. Nature
          herself seems convulsed with his sly sport.
          Her groans over a fallen race turn into in?
          voluntary, hysterical laughter at the bidding
          of this giant Harlequin, on whose kingdom
          tbe Ban never sets.
          The most pathetic scenes provoke the
          wildest mirth. We see men of bonor and
          repaie taking advantage of National schemes
          to secare private emolument; dividends the
          only consideration, the divisor of no conse?

          COPTBIOHi; 183 L
          H E stage is in
          Eomo measure
          responsible for
          All Fool's day.
          So the histo.
          rians tell us.
          They say it
          grew out of an
          old Easter
          miracle play in
          Irhich the sending of Christ from An
          bas to Caiaphas and from Pilot to
          Herod was the basis of the mediaeval
          Jramatist's plot. But I don't think
          Hie stage has stuck to its offspring.
          We actors are a serious lot of people,
          particularly the comedians among us,
          for paradoxical as it may seem, acting
          Is all work and no play, and conse
          quently Jack is a dull boy. We would
          "MSTEIt, TXEASE GIVE ME A IIFT. JTLI.
          TOU?"
          T like to April fool our manager, perhaps,
          but we don't April fool ourse'ves, be
          cause that would be rather cruel.
          I have outgrown the frolicsomenes
          of April 1, of course; still I always look
          carefully after my coat tails on that
          day. And I greatly enjoy the motley
          of those who are careless about their
          parraental caudals during the Feast of
          All Fools. The sight makes me feel
          quite a boy again, for we youngsters
          used to do that sort of thing in Phila
          delphia thirty years ago. 0 yes, I did
          It, too. I believe that some of the live
          lier children of Philadelphia do it yet,
          and have vitality and energy enough
          left to laugh at the result, as a comio
          paragrapher would say.
          The most foolhardy of all the tricks
          which I can recall in connection with
          this carnival of jeering and nonsense
          Is one that I have never seen played
          Eince I was old enough to require two
          digits to express my age. A bag and
          two boys were the ingredients of the
          trick, and it never failed to 6core a
          great success on a quiet side street.
          One boy got into the bag and the other
          Stood by it waiting for the victim. The
          rest of the boys who were "in on the
          ground floor" were hiding in hallways
          and doors and behind trucks across
          the street. An innocent citizen came
          W sauntering along. The boy who had
          hold of the neck of the bag stopped
          him with a "Say, mister, please give
          toe a lift, will yer?" The innocent cit
          izen usually acquiesced and took hold
          of the bag to land it on the youngster's
          shoulder. Just as he got it fairly in
          his hands the boy in the bag suddenly
          kicked and screamed. Innocent vic
          tim, thinking it a bagful of wildcats
          or hypnas. let go quickly and ran off
          with palpitating heart and hair on end.
          while all the boys across the street
          pursued him with a villainous chorus
          of "April fool 1 April fool! Wash
          .your face and go to sclioU" or
          something to the same effect. It
          Talways seemed to me that the joke
          was really on the boy in the bag;
          he was sometimes dropped hastily
          and heavily and was hurtand occa
          sionally the April-fooled citizen gave
          him a thrashing besides for being too
          funny. But it was an effective trick.
          and often an old codger lingered in the
          shadow on the opposite pavement to
          witness and enjoy the sport. You have
          seen a man try to kick a plug hat full
          of pig iron over into tho next state
          Trell, bis discomfiture was no greater
          IT MADE AIM SMD.E.

          than that of the man whoso blood was
          frozen in his heart by the unexpected
          scream emitted by the occupant of the
          bag. Laugh? It would make a tomb
          stone roll over in a fit of hysterics.

          It doesn't seem right that the firs
          flay of a month so full of pretty things
          j is April is should be inseparably con
          w nectcd in our minds with empty ard
          dilapidated pocketbooks with string
          in d-small-boy attachments, di&rep
          ntable hats with bricks underneath
          them, long streamers hanging from
          l nnsuspecting coattails, door bells
          rung by invisible hands, and all the
          other dear old pleasantries that we
          know by heart. And we should prob.
          ibly have had a society for the pre
          rention of Anril fool iokes Ions aso if
          It were not for the pleasure that call
          aren gel out of them.

          Informs me that somebody is waiting

          world would I refuse to go downstairs
          and pretend extreme surprise at find
          ing nobody there. Nor would any
          thing induce me to decline the suspicious-looking,
          cotton-filled piece of

          Apropos of this train of thought
          there is a little picture of mine in Puck,

          TO LESSEN THE DEVTL'S FOOLS.
          I am abked for a sentiment concern
          ing April Fool's day and pause in the
          whirl and rush of a righteous warfare
          to say that in my opinion time is far
          too valuable and important a factor
          for a moment to be lost in foolish jest
          ing or senseless joking. The world,
          especially in these days, is in far too
          critical and dangerous a position, so
          cially and religiously, to allow of a
          man with average sense to saj' noth
          ing of those who have consecrated
          brains to indulge in any other than
          profitable and upright intercourse.
          It is a personal relief to me to feel
          that in our ranks seventeen hundred
          officers and sixteen thousand unpaid
          local workers will be pushing with
          might and main of soul an enterprise
          which upholds sincerity and the ne
          cessity of lessening the devil's fools.
          Ballington Booth.
          A CHA3IPI0X FOR THE DAT.
          Before stating what jokes seem to
          me timely, and enjc&abJe ior this
          S&-
          WIPE DE FLOOB WID niil."
          April Fool's day, I cannot resist th
          temptation to say that I think the
          spirit of the holiday itself hat always
          been singularly misunderstocd. The
          day is really to be deemed a pause in
          time's serious flight, when folly could
          with propriety travesty wisdom, and
          set the world smiling. As it is, the
          first of April has come to be deemed a
          nuisance, wheu its observance is not
          don away with entirely. April Fool's
          day is sadly in need of soue one to
          champion it and xestoi e it to its right
          ful place in the calendar. It is not
          simply the day on which the boys and
          girls may make fools of their elders
          with impunity. I suspect that there
          was a time when it was regarded
          rightly, far away as that time seems
          to us now. Then the old people put
          aside their serious looks and grew
          younger instead of older.
          If it takes a wise man to be a fool,
          surely April first is the feast day
          of the saircs. when thev can act on
          Shakcspsare's admonition: "Mingle a
          little folly with your wisdom."
          As for those jokes which seem to mi
          good and appropriate to the dav it
          should always be understood that the
          element of surprise is the essential
          thing. Novelty is wit. Jokes must not
          bo cruel pranks, otherwise the day
          would ba given up to a general hazing
          of everybody. The most successful of
          April Fool jokes would be to surprise
          one's friends by a change of character.
          What a rare joke it would be for the
          confirmed miser to bestow a dowry
          upon that niece of his who needs only
          a little money to marry the lad of her
          choice. If all the cranks would put
          rside their hobbies for a day, what fun
          it would be for the rest of us.
          This kind of joke can be carried out
          ad finitum and would never fail to bo
          successful. Let the tippler remain
          sober to-day just as a joke. The skin
          flint employer can have a lark with
          his clerk by granting that increase of
          salary that has been talked about so
          long. Let the clergyman I say it
          reverently preach a sermon only an
          hour long to-day instead of one of
          four hours' duration. I am convinced
          that the idea would meet with success.
          People too old for jokes on April
          Fool's day? Xouscnc. Even the gray
          heads can have their joke. The repro
          bate roue can go to church this morn
          ing and explain that it is all a joke on
          his part. Many a man is ashamed to do
          a good thing because it is so unusual
          with him that it would give him un
          pleasant prominence. But he can do
          it to-day and escape with the admis
          sion that it is his April fool joke. I
          am glad the day comes on Sunday this
          year. B. Gillax.

          is not as hard as guessing the number of

          Nothing could exceed -the commoUon in
          the Senate when its courtesy was thus sat
          upon and spat upon by this intruder. It
          was the eagle eje of Senator Sherman
          of "Our Foreign Relations" Committee
          that discovered the intruder, winch was
          quietly looking askance at the President
          out of its white-winged eye, a beautiful
          queen red and gold parrot direct from Bar
          celona. "It Is a Spanish spy," declared Mr.
          Lodge.
          "It should be shot at drum head," as

          bird to fly down and light on tlie bald head
          of some Senator, like the eaglathat alighted
          on the head of the husband of Tanaquii.
          But the spy did not move, keeping his
          sinister eye on the Vice President, and
          evidently getting ready to sing his unwel
          come song again.
          Mr. Lodge Eutcka, lMr. President: Per

          The President Gqod; has the scrgeant-at-arms

          The sergeant-at-arms at -once procured
          Uie ladder on which he climbed into office,
          placed it up against the lintels of the' east
          door, and reached for ithe parrot, which
          was seated on the Senatorial clock a la
          Poc's raven.
          Did the sergeant-at-arms land the bird?
          Not on your negative. The bird had a
          string tied to him and. he'-was hauled aver

          APRIL CALLED
          OUT ALL ITS
          ARMY OF FOOLS
          The Jester and Victim
          Alike Make Merry.
          THE MORGUE'S BUSY DAY
          McENERNEY AND HIS COUN
          TERFEIT PRESENTMENT.
          Sad Tale of the Dentist Apprentice
          and the Soubrette Who Could
          Not Find the Key to the
          Curtain.
          April dawned bright and beaming and
          kept merry throughout its. first day
          blithely warbling between laughs, "Al!
          fools look alike to me."
          In spite of the fin de siecle pessimist
          and his prophecy that All Fool's day was
          a landmark of the past, the jester was
          out In splendid form and landed gudgeons
          galore.
          The fun began early and lasted late.
          A very few new jokes were perpetrated
          and all the old ones revived, while the
          usual good humor of both jester and vic
          tim prevailed during the entire day. The
          email boy was not so much in evidence
          ;is in previous years. Thoughts of Easter
          eggs on the morrow, coupled with the ar
          duous duties of trying on new suits and
          boots and hats, drove for once all
          thoughts of mischief from the mind of
          the budding lords of creation. The offi
          cials at the Morgue were the first to fall
          victims to the merriment- of the day.
          When the day was but a half hour old
          —at 12:30 a. m.— a telephone call, pre
          sumably coming from the Receiving Hos
          pital, summoned a Deputy Coroner to take
          charge of a body at the Hobson House.
          "Hurry-up wagon" and Deputy went
          quickly to the place, only to find that
          April had dawned and that some one un
          known wa? taking liberties with dignified
          city officials.
          In fact, the Morgue, or. rather, the
          Morgue's telephone, was the greatest fcuf
          fen-r during the day. The bell rang un-
          -ceasingly from early morning until mid
          i night and all sorts of messages were
          voiced- over the line. Heartless wretches
          also employes this method of fooling un
          suspecting friends.
          Tiner-aling-iing.
          "Hello! Well—"
          "Oh. la that you. Mary? This is Jim.
          Say Mr. Wilson wants to speak with you.
          Call him up— No. 1947."
          •'Hfllo. No. 1947! Ts this Mr. Wilson?"
          "No: this is the Morgue."
          A bang— that's Mary's telephone— a
          enwe— that is the Morgue.
          While people were having fun at the
          expense of the city the' city was enjoying
          Its own pet little April fool joke—repeat
          ing the prank over and over a^aln and
          hailing each new victim with shouts of
          applause and the shrill tooting of horny.
          At the junction of Market. Kearny. and
          Third streets at regular intervals a box,
          neatly packed and stamped, as though
          rc-ady for mailing, would glare the guile
          less pedestrian straight in the face. Many
          a man, woman and child, representing all
          sorts and conditions of society, stooped
          to pick up the innocent-appearing box.
          None got any farther than the attempt.
          The shouts of the crowd, many of them
          previous victims, scared the parcel-picker
          off, and he hastily lost himself in the
          throng and waited in his turn for some
          one to laugh at.
          It was both a costly and hair-raising
          April fool experience that Walter Mosier
          had. Mosier. a young man possessed with
          an ambition to learn dentistry, is em
          ployed by Dr. Perkins, a Sixth-street den
          tist. Walter's bogs occasionally allows
          him to putter around the molars of his
          customers who are out of funds.
          One of thes? occasions arose Friday and
          Mosier was delegated to perform the
          charity service. The, victim was a boy
          about 12 years of age. He was suffering
          from an ulcerated tooth, and Mosier de
          cided that the nerve must be killed, so
          forthwith he filled the cavity in the
          troublesome tooth with enough arsenic
          to kill a horse and sent the unfortunate
          youth home happy.
          When Dr. Perkins came in Mosier, with
          the dignity of a full-fledged dentist, told
          his employer of his charity work. Then
          Dr. Perkins thought of April fool.
          "Say, Mosier." said the dentist, with a
          serious look on his features. "I've just
          received a telephone message to the ef
          fect that the arsenic came out of that
          boy's tooth and he swallowed it."
          "My God!" exclaimed, the would-be
          dentist. lf ls he going to die?"
          "Well, the doctors are working on him
          now, but they don't think they can save
          his life."
          "Say. Doc, I'm going to get out of town
          before this kid dies. I don't want to get
          pinched."
          "Well." said Dr. Perkins, with a merry
          little twinkle in his eye. "You can suit
          yourself about that, but I'd advise you to
          stay here. They-can't do any more than
          charge you with mupder."
          "Murder! Ugh! Don't say that. Dr.
          Perkins," retorted Mosier, tearfully. "I
          didn't mean to do It. I'll go and take
          some arsenic myself."
          The crestfallen apprentice spent several
          moments of contrition and then he made
          up his mind to get out of town. He got
          50 cents from Perkins and made haste to
          the nearest barber-shop, where he Invest
          ed it in a haircut and a Bhave. M osier
          gave the tonsorial artist orders to cut
          }-is hair to the scalp and Bhave his sprout
          ing mustache entirely off, hoping thereby
          m disguise himself. The badly frightened
          youth then returned to the office to learn
          further detnils of his mythical victim's
          condition. Dr. Simpson told him th« boy
          was worse and Mosfer. started to leave the
          office. "Wait a minute." called Perkins.
          "Where are you going?'
          "God knows where I'll go, but I'll never
          go to jail for poisoning- that kid," an
          swered the youth.
          "You go down to the ferry to-morrow
          and if the boy dies I'll telephone to you,"
          suggested the doctor.
          Mosier slipped out to his mother's
          home, borrowed 510 and as early as 1
          o'clock yesterday morning he arrived
          at the ferry thoroughly disguised to
          avoid possible detection. He walked up
          and down the cheerless and 'desolate
          wharves till morning, and then not hear
          ing anything from Dr. Perkins bought a
          ticket for Sacramento and stole aboard
          the boat like a skulking criminal. On
          the train he acted for all the world like
          a noted forger crossing the line to Can
          ada.
          ttosiec confided to a friend before he
          left that he would commit BUicide rather
          than go to jail, which knowledge tuning
          to Dr. Perkins made him decide noi to
          cfrty the Josh any further. A message
          was sent to the frightened youth, and
          he returned to the city. Last night he
          set about to drown his troubles in the
          flowing bowl.
          Garret McEnerney fell a victim to a
          deeply laid April Fool plot laid for him
          by his "close up" friend Jim O'Brien..
          The bulky and brainy man of the law
          dropped into O'Briens office, commonly
          termed the "Cabinet," yesterday noon to
          engage the contractor in a little chat.
          "Say. Garret." chipped in O'Brien in
          an innocent fashion just when the law
          yer was i-xplaining to Jim Nealon the
          way to make money, "when did you
          stand for that bust over in the Palace?"
          "What bust?" queried Mr. McEnerney.
          "Why. the file they put in the corridor
          of the Palace Hotel this morning," said
          O'Brien as seriously as if he was talking
          business with a moneyed man who want
          ed- to spend a "thou or two" in street
          work.
          "There must be some mistake?" said
          McEnerney. "No sculptor ever chiseled
          me."
          O'Brien is "close up," and his words
          had weight with the man who was so
          busy dissolving -the injunction against
          Chief Lees that he did not stop to think
          of April Fool's day.
          "Let's go over, Jim, and take a look at
          it," said MeEnernty, and .they both start
          ed out tho door. O'Brien had no inten
          tion of going over with his friend to seek
          What he knew to be a myth, so he con
          trived to' be excused In a manner that
          would not breed suspicion.
          The opportunity presented itself when
          Judge Lawlor happened along.
          "I'm going to take the Judge on -for a
          minute," said O'Brien. "You go over and
          look at that yourself and I'll wait for
          you."
          Off went Mr. McEnerney and his April
          Fool went down on the arc.hives of the
          "Cabnit" as a decided success. Every.
          body who dropped into the Cabinet was
          sent over to the Palace Hotel to see what
          McEnernev had looked for in vain.
          "Pete" Dtinworth. the well-known vo
          calist, was- the victim of a ghastly April
          Fool josh. One of his friends telephoned
          to Dunworth's house early yesterday
          morning and informed him that an inti
          mate friend had died the night before
          and was to be buried immediately.
          "They, want you to be a pallbearer,
          Pete," said th-e wily person at the other
          end of the line.
          "All right." said the popular tenor, af
          ter expressing genuine regret over tae
          unexpected death of his friend.
          Promptly at 1 o'clock Dunworth, ar
          rayed in a black cutaway suit and white
          gloves, arrived at the .undertaking par
          lors from which the supposed dead friend
          was to have been buried.
          "Is this where Mr. So and So Is to be
          buried from." asked Dunworth, giving
          the undertaker the friend's name and ad

          "Why, he 1b not dead," said the under
          taker, "who knew the man very well. "I
          just ?aw him "at the corner of Sixth and
          Mission."
          At the Alcazar they revived the old the
          atrical joke of the "key of the curtain"
          with marked success. Mrs. Willie Dun
          phy, the latest addition to the company,
          ten minute* before curtain raising at thp
          matinee, was sent on a hunt for the "key
          to the curtain." "We can't open up."
          said Stage Manager Bryant. "We have
          lost the key to the curtain." Mrs. Dun
          phy. who glitters on the bills as Miss
          Howard, searched high and low for the
          key and was in a condition bordering on
          hVfiterics when the last bars of the or
          chestra died away and the curtain was
          lifted without a key.

          Concerning the origin of the name and custom of All fool's day
          contributed more to the extermination of
          the heathen religion and its priests than
          all the collateral aids of fire and sword,
          though they were also freely employed.
          The continuance of customs— especially
          droll ones, which suit the gross taste of
          the masses— after the original cause of
          them has been removed. Is a very common
          occurence. and by many antiquaries It is
          firmly believed that "fooling" people on
          the Ist of April is simply a perpetuation
          of the annual public ridiculing of the old
          Druid's and their superstitions.
          Still another oripin. of a semi-religious
          character, 13 thus claimed for April Fools'
          day In a quaint old book of folk-lore
          called "Father Time's Flyghtes." pub
          lished in London In 1659. "numerous
          Jewish Origin of the Custom of Making
          Fools on the First of April. This is said
          to have begun from "ye mistake of Noah
          sending ye dove out before ye water had
          abated, on ye first day of ye month which
          among ye Hebrews answers to our first
          of April, and to perpetrate ye memory of
          this deliverance it was thought proper
          whoever forgot so remarkable a circum
          stance to punish them by sending them
          upon some fool's errand similar to- the
          Ineffectual message upon which ye bird
          was sent by ye patriarch."
          The French associate with the first of
          April precisely the same Ideas as do Enr
          llsh speaking nations, but the person Im
          posed upon, whom we call an April FcJ*.
          they style an April Fl3h or Polsson d' -v
          ril. In the "Etymology of French pro
          verbs," a most curious and delightful
          work published In 1356. Billlngton I the
          author, gives the following expiation
          of the origin of April Fool customs "The
          word poisson is corrupted throtffn the
          Ignorance of the people from pasr'on. and
          length of time has almost totall- defaced
          the original intention, which w^ as fol
          lows: That as the Passion of c-n* Saviour
          took place about this time o'the year,
          and as the Jews sent Chris*; backward
          and forward to mock and't->rment him.

          from thence, by which we send about
          from one place to anoO«r such persona
          aa we think proper subjects of our ridi
          cule."
          But It Is not only thrjU&hout Great Brit
          ain, France and our/own country that
          fools are made on U« nrst day of April.

          throughout Sweden, aid In Germany an

          observed in India fr>m time immemorial.

          the Hull festival, of which the last day
          is the greatest aid most general holiday.
          During the con.nuance of the Hull, one
          of its chief dl^rsions is to send people
          on errands ar^ expeditions that are to
          end In disapr^ ntment anat the expend of the person sent.
          But the cistom of making April fools

          called "sleeveless errands." but the origin

          LOST
          In Antiquity of
          Ages.
          April Fool Kept by All
          People.
          Gigantic Hoax Was a Complete
          Success.
          "This Is the first of April,
          Hunt the gowk another mile."
          From time itruneiuorlal thollrstof
          April has been celebrated by all sorts of
          hoaxes and playing of pranks. Tho
          truo origin of April' Fool Is burled lu
          tho dust of centuries and our great
          est antiquaries seem unable to throw
          any light on tho subject. Nearly all
          people however, celebrate this day or
          its equivalent and the similarity of
          the practice and tho coincidence of
          dutes establishes without n doubt In
          the minds of authorities ihe fact that
          It had an early nnd common origin
          among mankind.
          Nearly all tho peoples on the Conti
          nent celebrate April Fool with pranks
          and tricks, and even the Hindoos havo
          a festival on tho 31st of March, called
          Hull, which coincides vjlth our April
          Fool.
          Ono of the most popular amusements
          on April 1, or All Fools day, as it Is
          called, Is tho Rending of persons on
          fruitless frrands. Unsophisticated
          persons are sent to tho bookstores for
          a copy of the "History of Eve's Grand,
          mother," or to the chemist's shop for
          "pigeon's milk," while small boys arc
          sometimes sent to the harness shop for
          strap oil, when a liberal dose of this
          treatment Is usually administered to
          the boy.
          There Is a story told to the effect
          that Francis, Duko of I,oiTaIne, mid
          his wife owed their escape from cap
          tivity at NanteH to this popular cus
          tom. Arrayed as peasants, they were
          makiug their way out. of the territory
          when they were discovered by a wo
          man who knew them. She Immediate
          ly hastened to a guard, and told him"
          that the Duko was escaping. "April
          Fool," said the guard laughingly,
          treating the matter as a joke, and
          while he laughed the prisoners made
          good tlieir escape
          Occasionally a gigantic hoax Is per
          petrated on tho people as a whole, and
          such a one met 'with groat success in
          London in I8RO. Some wag distributed
          cards, bearing an official looking seal,
          which read: "Tower of London Ad
          mit the bearer to vlorv the annual core,
          raony of the washing of the white lions
          on Sunday, Aprij, 1, 1800. It Is par
          ticularly requested that no gratuities
          be given to wardens or their assistants.
          Admitted only nt tho white gate."
          This trick was highly successful,
          and people swarmed to tho tower to
          view tho washing of tho whlto lions.

          JOKERS ANNIHILATE ARMIES
          April-Fool Pranks Play Havoc With
          European "War Map.
          According io me map wmcu t-roi.
          U p Wrench has prepared and kept
          I
          In the corridor of the third floor of
          Academic Hall, European armies have
          made radical changes in their ma
          neuvers. The French apparently have
          given up the war and have fled to the
          western coast of France. The Eng
          lish have disappeared entirely. All
          the German forces of the western
          theater are quartered in Paris. In the
          east, the Austrian and German forces
          are massed in the lowlands of Prus
          sia, surrounded by Russian and Ser
          vian troops. A few Servians are left
          as garrisons along the frontier. One
          lone Austrian army corps has escaped
          and is now stationed in the middle of
          the North Sea.
          The havoc Is attributed to some
          April Fool prank.
          Another Instance of April Fool
          thoughtfulness was shown this morn
          ing when a member of the Agricul
          tural faculty phoned to the county
          jail asking "who had left a call for
          him."

          SOPHY LA??GHAM'S DIARY.
          MALDON HALL, October 27, 1846.- I
          We have been a week here to-day,
          and I have never once opeued ray
          diary. Thwe is a blank iu my book j
          from that day we left oar dear mo?
          ther and our quiet house, till this;
          div, October 27. lint ?ts L have made j
          a ti rm resolution to keep a faithful
          chronicle of this year, (which is now
          fast waxing to its close,) I must write
          retrospectively, recordiug the events
          which have fiiled the week omitted, j
          us well us T can, from memory.
          Our part in;;- from mamma was a
          sad one. We had never left her be?
          fore, and both Margery and 1 feared
          she would be very lonely without us.
          We did not, on that account, wish tr)
          accept Miss Laugham's invitation,
          but our mother though it best that
          we should she has always regretted
          that we knew so little of my fa?
          ther's family, which was an ancient
          and wealthy one. It was their fault
          that we did not.
          Because my father (the son of a
          younger son) was not rich, only pos?
          sessing th?? pay of au officer of the
          army; and because ho had married a
          country clergyman's daughter, with
          only a moderate dower, they scarcely
          took any notice of him, au occasional
          invitation for the shooting season
          even gradually growing less frequent,
          till it ceased.'
          Sir Jonathan Langham, his uncle,
          lived m great style at Maldon Hall,
          but after Iiis death the maiden heir?
          esses "withdrew altogether from the
          world, and saw no one, not even inti?
          mate frierais. We had forgotten their
          existence, when Miss Langhain's let?
          ter of invitation to ourselves recalled
          them to our memories. It was really
          :i very touching epistle, though sim?
          ply and coldly worded.
          In her advanced age, she had lost
          her sister, and shorly after Miss Au
          gusta's deutli, a singular mortality
          <*r- had deprived lier of the two nephews
          w ho were next in succession to the
          property. "She was alone," sue
          said, "'iii the world, and a yearning
          had come over her to see und make
          acquaintance with poor Frank Lang
          ham's children. Would my mother
          span? us to her for a few weeks?"'
          "Allow me, however," continued
          the writer, "to explain that it is not
          with any view as to the disposal of
          my fortune that I send this invita?
          tion. Unhappily (as I cannot for?
          bear thinking) my father's will dis?
          poses of it, after the death of his
          daughters, to the next male heir, and
          this heir now appears to be a young
          Irishman, very distantly related;
          though, by a pure descent, he is one
          of the family. He is to visit mc
          shortly."
          My mother was divided in her re?
          solution to let ns go by this part oj
          the letter. Miss Langham could no!
          ascribe our visit to any mercenary
          motive. We could not. incur by it j
          degrading suspicion-so we came ti
          Maldon.'
          It was a cold autumn twilight when
          we entered the park, and a feeling ot
          strange awe, a kind of misgiving ol
          approaching evil, stole over me as 1
          watched the old trees bowing theil
          heads solemnly towards us. as if ii
          token of a gloomy welcome. I shiver
          ed. Margery looked round at rn?
          and said, laughing, "Somebody i:
          walking over your grave."
          "A more poetical Arab reading o
          vsuch creeping of the flesh is. Um
          something evil is near us," I re
          plied.
          "Thanks, Sophy. I am the onb
          person near yon," she said, merrily
          "There! you shivered again. An
          yon cold?'
          "No!" said I, "but very m elan ch o
          ly. Es there not something s uhlen
          ing in this old place, whose ancien
          trees have sheltered so many of ou
          race, long since gone?"
          "Not to me," said bright Margery
          "I can but think what a splendid in
          beril.mee it- is, und how I wish Mis>
          Langham would leave it to me. Lis
          ten-there is a chime of church boils
          Ts it iu honor of our appearance a
          the ancestral hall, do you think?''
          "No," said I. "the ringers are oubj
          pract icing.
          '"You are a strange mixture td' th?
          common-place and sentimental. So
          phy,"'said Margery. "Do the bell.?
          say nothing to you?"
          ""Only, 'Sophy anc Margery gc
          home again,' to my ear. not bei nf
          such an agreeable hes ing as Whit
          tington's was," said I.
          Then Margery beg in an cager dis
          enssion about bells and their varied
          voices, and how people always fane;
          they ?lear in them whatever tile;
          wish; which subject continued till w<
          drove up to the hall door of Maldon
          lt isa noble old pile; and as wi
          stepped in the ancient indi am
          glanced at the pillars and arches, tin
          old armor and trophies of the chase
          I could not help liking to feel that i
          had been the home of my ancestors
          A butler, whose age' and appear
          ance were in good keeping with th
          dwi liing, ushered na into the gram
          library, lighted by a large glowinj
          tire, near which sat an old lady, win
          rose as we entered, ami, leaning o?
          an ivory stick, advanced to greet ns
          A very stately person isMissLang
          ham, of Maldon, and her manner i
          wonderfully courteous and gracions
          I can use no other words. She lei
          us to seats near tho lire, and begun
          conversation by inquiring after th
          health of our mother ?ind ?issnring ti
          that she fell, grateful to mamma fo
          permitting us to visit her.
          knew your father very inti
          match- in my youth," she saul.
          were cousins, you know, but time
          and theichanges o? tho world divided
          us. He was some years younger than
          myself, but he is gone first."
          She sighed deeply, and gazed for a
          moment into tho blazing fire, which
          cast a long flickering shadow ol' her?
          self against tin- wall. Then turning
          her gaze full upon us, she added, ad?
          dressing me, "You most resemble
          your father.*'
          "So mamma says,"' 1 replied;
          "Margery is exactly like our mother."
          Miss Langham looked earnestly at
          my .sister, and Margery blushed be?
          neath tho fixed gaze of Um ?dd lady.
          How beautiful my sister looked in
          fin warm fire-??ght. There are few
          girls as lovely ns Margery, and so
          Miss Langham must have thought,
          though she could not, of course, ex?
          press her admiration.
          "I have two rither guests beside
          yourselves," she added, after a pause.
          "The heir of Maldon, Mr. Cornelius
          O'Haliorau, and a Langham-though
          of a remote brauch. They are out
          shooting, but will he introduced to
          you at dinner. Perhaps uow you
          would like to go to your rooms, ami
          take ?ff your bonnets."
          We assented, ami were conducted
          by Miss Langham herself to two
          charming bed-rooms, opening en suite,
          with a small boudoir.
          "These three rooms are at your
          disposal," she said. "Shall I send my
          maid to you?"
          1 declined, wit li thanks, adding
          that we had no lady's muid ourselves,
          and could dress without assistance;
          "or, at. least," T added, "wc help
          each other."
          The old holy nodded approvingly,
          ami walked away.
          We unpacked ami prepared for
          dinner; but ever and anon between
          this occupation, 1 walked to the win?
          dow and looked out upon the park
          and the sent gray landscape beneath.
          A new charm wa- added to the latter
          in the near tower of a fine old church,
          which rose above the trees; yet tho
          feeliug of depression which had
          Steden over me on our entrance into
          the park deepened as I looked out
          on the heritage of my family, and I
          thought that after ali it was pleasantei
          to live in our mo! lier's cheerful cot?
          tage, und ga/.e upon our own bright
          dower-beds and green lawn, with it.
          one old oak, than on the gloomy am:
          suggestive grandeur of an ancient am"
          extensive park.
          I was glad when Margery called
          me to assist her in dressing, for bet
          light chat ami anxiety as to how om
          dresses would look, drew my thought.'
          to cheerful commonplaces.
          Very lovely Margery looked tha
          evening. I felt quite proud of tin
          admiration 3. could perceive she ex
          cited.
          Just before dinner, the two gen
          tlemot. guests were introduced to u
          by Miss Langham. Her companion
          I a pleasant, chatty person, and th
          rector, a rather pompons old gentle
          man, who could appreciate the pow
          ?.rs of the Maldon cooli so well tim
          he talked very little, were of on
          party. The n et or's silence was atone*
          for, however, by the ceaseless chatte
          !-I can call it nothing else-of Mi
          i O'Halloran. He is the most astound
          ing individual lever met. Tall, hand
          some and admirably dressed, he i
          nevertheless vulgar, rcs, the heir o
          I Mahlou would never be taken for
          gentleman, if one did not know hi
          hirth. He has a most unpleasan
          I brogue, and uses expressions whic
          ?ire quaint, hut which gives one th
          idea of being the sayings of the Ami
          rican peasantry. However, he is ev:
          i deiitly studying to acquire a goo
          j manner, ami I could not help ol
          j serving that he both watched an
          imitated Anthony Langham, who i
          I as distinguished-looking as a Lan?
          liam should be.
          I have learned since from Mn
          Moore-Miss Langham's co m pan io
          -that the old lady is sensible of th
          want of refinement ia her kinsmai
          and regrets the relationship. If li
          had not made Iiis appearance in til
          most unexpected way from Americs
          Maldon would h.iv.- descended to Mi
          Anthony Langham, as next ma!
          heir, and Miss Langham motin
          over the entail which was to take e
          feet alter tin: death of herself and In.
          sister. Still, she was too high-bre
          to let Mr. O'Halloran see tlmt li
          displeases or disgusts her, and I fane
          he even thinks himself a favorite.
          Mr. O'Halloran is much strm
          with Margery's beauty, and offers In
          the wildest homage, paying her con
          pliments so persona] as to be quit
          un pleasant. My sister blushes an

          nigs, doings, thoughts and feelings
          tho past week. So, adieu, neglected
          time! All the impression thou has
          left is just that I lore Miss Langham,
          like her comp; ton, detest the heir,
          and pity that c._rming young Lang?
          ham, who should have been the m?s?
          tet-of the old plac?. He is all that
          the lord of such a heritage ought to
          be-manly, courteous, gentle, kind
          and intelligent.
          Margery does not share my horror
          of O'Halloran. She began by laugh?
          ing at him; she now laughs with him,
          and actually declares that his eyes are I
          very fine, and that he is handsomer
          than Anthony Langham!
          If it were any other girl but Mar?
          gery, I should say she saw him through
          a golden glamour.
          OCTOBER 28.-Wo are to have a
          large party here on Hallowe'en, the
          :'.lsr. Miss Langham likes keeping
          up old customs, and we are to have
          all the weird rites of the charmed
          evening carried out.
          Site has presented Margery and me
          with new dresses for the occasion
          very pretty ones they are.
          My beautiful sister has evideutly
          won tho hearts of both our kinsmen.
          Anthony Langham loves her, I can
          see, though he is kept from her by
          the constant watchfulness of Mr.
          O'Halloran; so, to console himself,
          he takes refuge with me and admires
          her to me, and listens.to my sisterly
          praises with pleased smiles.
          Happy Margery! If she marries
          him, she will be truly fortunate. I
          told her so this evening, as we were
          dressing for dinner, but she only
          laughed and said:
          ..What, should we live on, Sophy?
          He has only his wits for dower."
          A nobler inheritance, in my mind,
          than Maldon itself.
          Ah! how the wind howls and moans
          through the trees. The night is full
          of noises. Surely I hoard a bolt
          opeued down stairs. If it, should be
          robbers!
          I have listened, for some time, with
          a beating heart, but there has been
          no repetition of the grating sound;
          it must have been my fancy or the
          v. ind.
          I will close my book, say my
          prayers and go to bed; it is silly to
          write so late, with my lire just out
          and my room gloomy from the feeble
          light of my candles. It makes me
          nervous and fanciful; so good night,
          my diary.
          NOVEMBER 1.-I resume my diary
          to-night, because I dare not enter in
          it, by day, the events of the past
          twenty-four hours. Margery might
          glance accidentally over my shoulder,
          or wonder what moved me so much,
          and ask questions impossible to an?
          swer.
          My hand shakes visibly as I write,
          Alas! I half regretted that my diarj
          was so barren of incident; that tin
          days were so monotonous and un
          marked by any landmarks of memory
          I have incident enough now to record
          to my sorrow.
          Hallowe'en came. A large party as
          sembledin lin' stately saloon, opene?
          for the first time in forty years. Wi
          had a grand dinner in the banquet
          ing-room, at which Miss Langhau
          did not preside, the rector taking he
          place; and. after dinner, we joinec
          her in the drawing-room, and began
          under her direction, the magic rite
          of the evening.
          We burned nuts together (bavin;
          named them first) and read a laugh
          ing augury from their explosion o
          quiet combustion. We felt (blind
          folded) for cups holding earth, watei
          emptiness, and one a pocket-pistol
          these symbols being prophetic of on
          future husbands' professions; an
          Mr. O'Halloran loudly exclaime
          against t he truth of the oracles, whe;
          Margery put her little hands into th
          empty basin, which foreboded singl
          li ft-.
          The fun of the evening moved eve
          Miss Langham to merry smiles.
          must have seemed as if a glimpse
          her youth had revisited her. Ourin
          a pause she said:
          '"There are some Hallowe'en ritt
          mure trying to the nerves than thesi
          sowing hemp-seed, for example."
          "What is that?" we asked, sima
          tatieously.
          "The lady who questions fate," si
          replied, "takes some hemp-seet
          goes, at midnight, to the chard
          yard, and sows it around the belfr;
          tower from whence peal themarriag.
          bells, ?iud says:
          Hemp-seeds, I saw yen;
          Hemp-seeds, I mow you;
          And he that shall marry mo,
          Come after me and harrow ye."
          We laughed, and O'Halloran (wi:
          had appeared to better ad vanta'
          under these livelier auspices) declare
          that he wished some of the ladi
          would try it.
          A universal exclamation of dislil
          to the experiment wat answering hir
          whet: a footman entered, and, a]
          proaehing Mr. O'Halloran, told hi
          that a person wished to speak to hi
          on imperative business.
          I fancied that O'Halle.ran change
          countenance a little, but he laugh?
          still, and hoping that somebody wou
          prove heroic and try the hemp-sec
          sowing, he left the room.
          The conversation continued on tl
          same subject; Miss Langham, wi!
          quiet humor, regretting that tl
          courage of the young ladies of tl
          nineteenth century was so much inf
          rior to that of the damsels of aneie
          times, tili, in playful daring, loden
          to sow hemp-seed myself. For a m
          ment, sin? hesitated," then she replie
          "So you shall, Sophy! Only,
          stipulate that you .shall wrap yours?
          in a large shawl, and sow your hem
          seed running, to keep yon warm. Ti
          church is so close at hand, and so pi
          vate, (shut into the grounds,) that
          there is no real cause for fear."
          "Surely you won't go. Miss Sophy?"
          was the general erv, and Mrs. Moore,
          approaching me. remonstrated in a
          low tone, saving that Miss Langham
          was a little childish on these points,
          and I had really better not go; but a
          sudden resolution possessed me to j
          undertake the adventure, and I per?
          sisted in it.
          About ten minutes or a ?plai ter to
          twelve, I left the hall, alone, wrapt in
          a heavy woolen shawl, which J drew
          over my head. T was followed by the
          good wishes and remonstrances of
          most of the guests, who escorted me
          to the door.
          It was a bright moonlight night,
          and my shadow was east on the gravel
          carriage-road almost as distinctly as
          in the sunshine. Tin' wind sighed
          mournfully through the trees, that
          waved their lai'ge arms above my
          head; and I confess, when I turned
          down the steps leading to the church?
          yard, a thrill of awe-T would not
          allow it to bc fear-passed through
          me.
          Everything 'A MS SO still and hushed,
          and tho tall shadow of the steeple fi ll
          so clearly on the ground in the solemn
          light, that I felt uneasy at. the idhi
          desecration of observing such a pagau
          rite on the holy ground.
          As I approached the church more
          closely, this feeling of reverential re?
          luctance to perform my foolish task
          increased. Alas! if I had only obeyed
          it! 1'ut it vas combated by thc fear
          of ridicule, and of the doubts my
          companions might feel as to my real
          motive for not completing my task,
          as well as by a reluctance, to cast im?
          plied blame ou so aged a lady as our
          kind hostess. So I took the basket
          in my hand, and scattered fae hemp
          seed, whispering the formula, as ran
          round t he tower.
          Suddenly I heard the sound of foot?
          steps. A superstitious fear, whicb
          was quite uncontrollable, seizt il me.
          I darted into an embrasure of t hc
          wall, and crouched breathless behind
          a large buttress.
          The next, moment, heard voicei
          as well as footsteps. They caine verj
          near, and paused close by my hiding
          place.
          "I tell you," said one voice, "it i:
          of no use to make a fool of yourself
          You must get the property ut once
          or you will be found out. Here's tin

          get the estates, "lint my belief is. w
          are all right, and shan't fail of success
          Having taken in the lawyer hitherto
          as well as Ih.e old woman, we have n
          real cause to fear at present; it's
          long way to Ameriky. and it's nothiu
          but your impatience to share tie- pr'
          perty that makes ,tm urge such hast?
          Uncle Ned."
          "Uncle Nedi'- The voice of th
          speaker thus named was that of a tal
          fine-looking footman, whom Mis
          Langham had engaged soon after h<
          sister's death, when she resumed lu
          long-interrupted intercourse with th
          world.
          "Well, you have heard what Joh
          Green said. He wouldn't have com
          down to-night to warn us for nothing
          Give her this dost?,'' continued th
          voice of the footman, ''amt you wi
          be master here by to-morrow."
          "I have said I won't, and I won't,
          replied O'Halloran, doggedly. "Yo
          may do it. yourself, if you ?ike; bi
          mind, I don't ?misent to it."
          The footman laughed, and said:
          "A precious bull that! but am ti
          old a bird to be took with chaff,
          ain't going to put my head in au 'alb
          for any one; but I advise- you io tal
          Jack's advice ?md warning. Now.
          must go; it's nigh upon supper-tim
          and I shall be missed."
          They moved on. The next minut
          O'Halloran's foot crushed somethin?
          quite audibly in the stillness.
          "Hilloa!" said he, with .1:1 oat!
          "what's this? Hemp-seed all abu
          the path!" Another oath. "Son
          of those confounded gals have bei
          strewing it, then! Can we have bet
          overheard?"
          "Nobody was here a minute or tv
          ago," replied Ned; "I looked behii
          every buttress before we be.em
          talk.'"
          "They may have como since. F<
          low the track of the seed sa
          O'Halloran.
          And they did follow it, with fat
          accuracy, and drew me, shiverii
          with fear and horror, from my bi
          ing-place.
          "Miss Sophy!" cried Uncle Ned,
          a tone of dismay. Then, with fen
          fid oaths, which even now ring
          my ears, he drew a large claspkni
          from his pocket. I saw the bim
          glitter in the moonlight. 1 shut n
          eyes, and thought a rapid prayer.
          "Ned," said O'Halloran, in a win
          per, "it won't do! Detection wou
          be certain. Go home and wait, f
          fear you should be missed; w
          take caro of the gal."
          Still swearing, Ned loosed h
          hold, but O'Halloran held my ot!;
          arm firmly.
          "Now, Miss Sophy," he said, as
          were left, alone, "you have learnt
          your fate, and 110 mistake. Lie yt
          "must, and that this instant, unie
          yon swear by all the saints in t!
          calendar that you will never tell
          word of what you've heard th
          blessed night to any human soul."
          I hesitated; surely death would 1
          preferable io even an ia volunta:

          But this heroic decision .lid not

          self, just as it' it had been somebody
          else. The youri? life seemed more
          precious to me than the old iuherit-I
          ance of our race.
          I weighed (with the rapidity pf

          ALL HALLOW EVE.
          The Sast of Octdber, the eve of All Saints I
          Day, has been for ages a timeof festivities,
          peculiar costumes and ceremonies, in the
          old countries, but of these there are few
          traces in our country. It is a season when
          fairies and wood-land elves come out in
          force, play pranks on passers by, dance
          merrily on the bill sides, and perform fa
          vors for those who have the good fortune
          to meet with them and fall into their good
          graces The weather had been very wet
          and disagreeable for some days, but on
          Saturday it cleared up cool and pleasant.
          SIn "the good old days" the young folks
          gathered in the evening to enjoy the plays
          and stories of the time. One legend di
          Srects the young girls who wish to know
          who their future husbands will be, to go
          to a grocery store and there steal a her
          B ring; taking it out of the brine it must be
          roasted without washing or cleaning, and
          e eaten up. They must then go backwards
          s to bed and drink no water. During the
          Snight the future partner of their joys will
          Sappear and offer them water from a clear
          running brook. Many a bonnie lass bas
          taken her supper of salted herring and
          gone to rest, to dream that she was laying
          Sin the shade of some favorite tree. with a
          Smurmuring brook close by, the cool waters
          of which were temptingly near her parched
          lips. yet be3yond the most frantic efforts to
          .reach it in her dreams. On this night
          they pull the Yarrow and sleep on it, the
          charm of which will bring them a vi.son
          of their sweet-heart. Going to the fields
          they pull nine blades of the plant, repeat
          ing at each:
          "All hail to the Yarrow, the wisest of
          flowers,
          SThon flairest of floweTrs to me,
          I tryete thee to tell io,, before morn
          Who my true lovec shall be."
          SThey then retire to rest and must speak
          no more until 'Ster they have slept. The
          following legend I believe has never been
          in print, ~althoughl it is quite current in
          C the north of Ireland, where it is believed
          by many to be true:
          wAsHING IN TRE DEVIL'S NA1t
          one Hallow eve night two young girls, liv
          ing on the coast of Ireland, nearthe Island
          Magee. went to a neighboring rivulet and
          Swasheditheir linen under garment in the
          r name of the Devil asking to be shown be.
          fore lorning their future husbands. Re
          tunrwiig to their rooms they spread the gar
          ments out to dry and each placed on the
          table a plate with bread and cheese for
          the expected visitors and then retired to
          bed. During the night they were awak
          ened by a most terrible storm, with vivial
          flashes of lightning, during one of which
          the shadow of a coffin moved through the
          room and stopped by the plate of the
          younger girl and immediately after a
          young man in sailor's clothes entered the
          room and going to the plate of the other
          cut some bread and cheese, and then dis
          appeared but left his sailor's knife on the al
          table. Before the year was out the young- of
          eat girl died, and soon after there was a
          storm and a ship wreck. One of the young
          sailors who was saved fell in love with the of
          other girl and they were married. Their ii
          union was blessed with a son, and while pi
          the wife was laying in bed, her husband
          asked for a knife to out some bread. She bi
          directed him to look in the cup-board. hi
          In Heaven's name, where did yon get
          this I" he asked holding up the sailor's w
          knife while his face was pale and colorless ki
          as death. After much urging she told him. bl
          How dare you do such a thing 1" he cried 01
          in a great rage that night we bada storm
          and I was washed overboard, and then suf- of
          fered the pains of the damned. No won- sa
          der I felt the flames of hell when you were s1
          working charms on me I" In his fury he a
          stabbed her with the knife and then left w
          the house and was seen no more. She re
          covered after a long illness and her son
          lived to be an old man. Some of his de- j
          cendants are said to be yet living in Coun- p
          ty Antrim. These are some of the quaint b
          customs and stories of Hallow Eve which b
          passing away brings as to,

          The Bight When Maidens Try to Find Out
          Who Will Wed Them— A Curious Cir
          cumstance-Tricks Flayed.
          Written for The Morn*in*g Call
          All boys and girls know that October 31st
          is "All Hallow Even," though most of them
          corrupt its name to "Holly Eve." They
          know that it is a night of mirth and mys
          tery specially devoted to mischief, fun, in
          cantations,' divination charms and spells,
          but very few of them or their elders under
          stand its real significance or can tall whence
          it derives its name.
          It is many centuries since the Roman
          Church, finding it impossible, from the
          great aud constantly increasing multitude of
          the saints, to set apart a separate day for
          each one, decreed that November Ist should
          thenceforward be kept as a day in honor of
          all the saint!), and that It should bo known
          as All Hallow Mas, or All Saints' day, and
          that the night of October 31st, immediately
          preceding it, should thereafter be kept as a
          vigil aud known as All Hallow eve, th°se
          occasions beine still observed In the Cath
          olic, Episcopal and Lutheran churches.
          From its first origination Hallow eve has
          been invested with a peculiarly mystic
          character. It is an almost universal super
          stition that supernatural influences then
          have unusual power— that devils, witches
          and fairies are abroad; that all spirits are
          free to roam through space, and that the
          spiritual element in .ill livinglhum&nity can
          be detached from corporeal restraint and
          made to road its own future or to reveal to
          others what fate may have In store for them.
          As there is nothing in the church celebra
          tion of the ensuing day of All Sain's to
          justify these singular ideas and customs as
          sociated with Hallow eve, nnd an none of
          them are of a religious character, we may
          justly regard them as relics of pagan times.
          In all ages and countries Hallow eve has
          been dceiued. as it still Is, the occasion par
          excellence for devilling the answer to that
          momentous question which absorbs so laree
          a share of the thoughts of romantic young
          men and maidens, "who is to marry whom?"
          The means employed to gain this much de
          sired information are as quaint and curious
          as they are numerous and varied. For this
          purpose
          EVEBY TIME AND EVERY COUNTRY—
          Almost every district of every country— has
          had its own charms and spells peculiar to it
          self, and they lava furnished up almost in
          exhaustible theme to folk- poets and com
          pilers of folk-lore. Those of Scotland have
          been most graphically described by that
          greatest of all poets of the people, Itobert
          Burns. In his poem of "Halloween" ha
          has given us a most vivid account of more
          than half a score of Hallow eve charms
          and spells peculiar to the Scottish peasantry.
          In a very old book of folk-ore called "Vo
          True Arte To Keade Ye Future" 1 find the
          following: "If a maid would know ye
          name of ye man she is to marry, let her on
          All Hallow even steal out to a lime-kiln and
          throw therein a clue of blue yarn, still hold
          ing to ye other end. Piesentlv ye end In ye
          kiln will be sharuly pulled. Then ye maid
          must say 'who holds?' Whereupon ye voice
          of her future husband will pronounce his
          name both ye Christian and ye surname."'
          The only obstacle to the successful per
          formance of this spell is the difficulty of
          finding an old lime-kiln, but as lime-kilns
          will be In great demand among our young
          women when the important statement m ide
          in the above paragraph becomes generally
          known, aud us a demand for any article in
          this country is speedily met by an abundant
          supply, the number of lime-kilns will doubt
          less sunn be largely augment-, d, to the great
          delight of anxious match-making mammas
          and their dutiful offspring.
          Water, nuts and apples bear a prominent
          port in the spells and charms of Hallow
          eve. A quaint old book of charms, pub
          lished in Edinburgh in 1070, entitled: "Old
          Father Time's Bundle of Faggots Newly
          Bound Up," declares that an infallible
          means of getting a view of your future hus
          band or wife is to go to bed on Hallow eve
          with a glass of water, in which a small
          sliver of wood has been placed, standing on
          a table by your bedside. li: the night
          YOU WILL DItEAM OF FALLING
          From a bridge Into a river and of being
          rescued by your future wife or husband,
          whom you will see us distinctly as though
          viewed with waking eyes. This charm is
          thus alluded to by the English poet Gay:
          Last Hallow eve 1 loured my love to see,
          Ami [rid a spell to call tier up to me.
          With wI dreamed a dream and saw my own sweet bride.
          IniCOIIDectiOO with tills spell I am remind
          ed of a curious circumstance which came
          under my immediate observation. While
          visiting my younger brother in Newton,
          Mass., some year aij", my sister-in-law com
          plained at the breakfast table on the morn
          ing after Hallow eve that she had spent a
          most wretched night. On my inquiring tho
          cause she stated that she had hud a strange
          ly vivid and most singular dream, from
          which she had awakened with a feeling of
          the most distressing exhaustion. She
          dreamt that she was walking along the
          bank of a river, when a gentleman whose
          face she saw as plainly and distinctly as
          she had ever seen anything and whose
          features were indelibly imprinted upon her
          memory, fell from a bridge erected across
          the stream. Without a moment's hesita
          tion she plunged into the wat«r and after a
          desperate struggle succeeded iv bringing
          him ashore, whereupon she awoke feeling
          as much exhausted as if she bad actually
          passed through such a thrilling experience.
          In less than three mouths from that time
          my brother sickened and died. His young
          widow continued to reside in the same place
          with her two children. Four years later I
          again paid, her a visit, and while a guest at
          her house I learned that a bachelor Iriend
          of mine would be in the neighboring city
          of Boston on a certain date, and 1 tele
          graphed him to visit me at Newton. I met
          him at the railway station and drove him to
          my sister-in-law's residence.
          It was a beautiful summer evening, and
          looking from the carriage as we approached
          the house we Jaw her watering some
          flowers on the lawn. At sight of her my
          friend seemed so much agitated that 1
          anxiously Inquired the reason of his dis
          composure and asked if he had ever seen
          the lady before. He hud barely time to
          answer, "Yes, once, aud I will tell you all
          about it when 1 have an opportunity," be
          fore we had alighted and were in her pres
          ence. To my amazement she seemed quite
          as much discomposed as my Irietid had been.
          He subsequently told me that on the very
          Hallow eve when my sister-in-law had
          dreamed the dream above mentioned he had
          tried the spell of the glass of water and the
          sliver of wood recommended by my "Old
          Father Time's Bundle of Faagots," which 1
          had loaned him, and that ho had dreamed
          of falling off a bridge into a river, and of
          being rescued by the lady in whose house
          we then were, and whom he paw In his
          vision as distinctly as when he beheld her
          that night on the lawn. 1 also learned from
          my sister-in-law that my friend was the
          very man she had dreamed of rescuing on
          that same Hallow eve.
          The story of this most curious coinci
          dence, which is literally true, exactly as
          stated, is made complete by the fact that
          THIS FAIR OF DItEA.MKItS
          Were made man and wife before another
          Hallow eve.
          In a folk-lore book called "Ye Mysteries
          of Ye Wy.cnecraft," which Is the oldest in
          my collection, there is given a charm "by
          which a maid may know if ye man site
          loves be true." To perform this the maid
          Is directed to pluck, at midnight on All
          Hallow eve, two monthly roses with long
          stems naming one for herself aud the other
          for her lover, She must then go directly to
          her sleeping-room without speaking to any
          one and kneeling beside her bed must twine
          the stems of the two roses together and
          then repeat ihe following lines, meanwhile
          gazing intently upon the rose named for
          her lover:
          Twine, twine ail Intertwine,
          Let my love be wholly mine
          If In heart be kind and true.
          Deeper grow his rose's hue.
          IT If her swain be faithful the color of the
          rose representing him will grow darker and
          mure intense.
          Of all the many Hallow eve spells and
          charms associated wtth nuts, one of the old
          est is that which prevails in some of Eug
          laud'g northern counties), and which Is to
          the effect that if a young man or woman
          will go at midnight on Hallow eve to a
          Highest of all in Leavening Power. Latest U. S. Gov't Report.
          ABSOLUTELY PURE
          walnut tree and walk around it three times,
          crying each time: "Lot him (or her) that is
          to be my true love bring me some walnut*,"
          the future wile or l:u-tl>iind will be seen in
          the tree withering its fruit. The poet Gay
          thus refers iv his "Pastorals" to this cus
          tom:
          Last Hallow eve I souztit a walnut trie.
          In hopes my true love'a face that I might see.
          Three tune* I called, three times 1 waned apace,
          Then in the tree I saw my true love'a lace.
          A VEKY OLD HALLOW KVK DIVINATION,
          Formerly much practiced by English rustics
          to tell from what quarter of the compass
          the future husband or wife will come, i*
          performed by stealing out unobserved at
          midnight, plucking a small luck of hair
          from one's head and casting it to tlm breeze.
          Whatever direction it is blown toward is be
          lieved to be the location of the future
          matrimonial partner. This divination, is
          also mentioned by Gay in his "Pastorals,"
          as follows:
          I pluck this lock of hair from out my bead
          To ten whence comes the one that 1 shall v.cl:
          My. silken hair, fly alt the worm around.
          Until you reach the spot where my true love Is
          found.
          There can be no question that many of
          the observances of Hallow eve are derived
          from those of the old Koninn festival cf
          Pomona, when divinations and the consult
          ing of oracles mid omens were universally
          practiced. Lighting bonfires is one of the
          oldest aud most universal of Hallow eve
          usages, yet the Germanic and Celtic na
          tions were both accustomed to kindle them
          on October 31st, centuries before they ever
          heard of the Christian religion, ana its vigil
          of All Hallow eve. It Is probable that the
          boys of those old races indulged, on that
          date, in the same mischievous practices
          which now afford so much pleasure to our
          own youngsters, and no doubt the little
          sons and daughters of the ancient Romans,
          Germans and Celts carminated the munici
          pality (or, in the vulgar, "painted the town
          led") quite as extensively as our own chil
          dren do now by ringing door-bells and run
          ning away before they can be answered,
          beating iv the panels of frontdoors with
          cabbage-heads, misplacing signs, gates and
          fences, aud raising Old Nick generally.

          'TIS FAIRIES' MGHT.
          ALL Halloween, when to youb
          sight may be, i ween,
          BernUM Tour Fntnrv Spouse's Fsw, la
          All IU Cgllneas and Grace That's 'What
          Think In the "Anld but
          Hardly, I Trow, on This Sldn the Sea.
          A Scotch writer who contributed an
          article to an American newspaper about
          Halloween last year declared himself
          "very much impressed by the almost
          universal observance of Halloween and
          its old customs in America." Ho added
          that the forms most taken by tho observance
          of tho nigh there were, and equally
          to his interest, rather Scotch-Irish
          than English. Farther on ho says that
          "Halloween has always been and still
          trrmcG at lugging or gates.
          is the feast of the year, when gentle
          and simple meet and enjoy themselves
          together, irrespective of social barrier
          and caste, so rigorously observed on
          other occasions.
          This view of Halloween will perhaps
          be entirely new to a majority of those
          who read this writing. Halloween is
          observed in the United States, to be
          sure, and perhaps in some parts of the
          country with some of the same superstition
          that marks its observance among
          tbo&e who dwell on the British isles,
          but this is rarely the fact among those
          of the 'old time American stock. This
          is especially true of those descended
          from the Puritans. Thoso sturdy old
          iconoclasts cast out all sorts of belief
          regarding saints' days and pagan festi
          vals, including even Christmas and the
          Eastertide, in their prohibition of celebrations
          that savored of either the Roman
          church or the Druids. Tho observance
          of Halloween is a mixture of
          both, and I have no doubt that there
          are many thousands in the United
          States, some of whom will read these
          words, who were in as dense ignorance
          of Halloween in their childhood as
          was a business man of one of our
          largest cities with whom I converted
          the other daj.
          "I never heard of Halloween" at all
          when I was a boy, said this man. ""'1
          never heard of Easter either until I
          was 17. of 18. Full knowledge of both
          did not come to me till I 'went away to
          school' with money I had earned work
          ing in the hayneld and the apple orchard,
          and then I read their history in
          the 'Book of Days.' But I knew all
          about Paas (I used to spell it Pees) and
          cabbage night. I used to hide eggs in
          the haymow for days, waiting for the
          first, and the standing cabbages and the
          winging gates of the neighbors used to
          suffer on the second, I tell you.
          Cabbage night! That's the title the
          American boy applies to Halloween.
          And a right lusty, sturdy savage the
          American boy is like to be on that night
          It must be confessed that the joys of
          cabbage night, its breathless exertions
          and runnings here and there in the darkness,
          its pulling of bells and knocking
          at doors, its lifting and lugging of gates,
          its stretching of ropes across paths to
          trip the unwary, all seem rather flat
          and silly to the man whose hair is getting
          gray and who is beginning to be
          fat or rheumatic or perhaps both. But
          they weren't flat and silly some 20 or
          SO years ago, were they, old fellow? Do
          you rememberwhat fun you had stealthily
          tying two cabbages to Deacon Ellis'
          front door knob on cabbage night
          in 186? or 1868? How you then knocked
          at the door and dodged behind the
          big cherry tree in the yard where Tom
          Waters was hidden before you? How
          you then saw the young theological student,
          who was "settin up" with the
          deacon's pretty niece, when he opened
          A LITTLE SERMOX.
          the door? How he was so angry when
          he saw the joke that he began to say
          something that sounded very much like
          a "big, big DV How you snickered so
          loud that he heard you, and darting out
          into the darkness caught you both and
          dragged you into the parlor, where he
          stood you, nearly helpless with mortification,
          before his sweetheart, preached
          you a little sermon, smiling the while,
          which sounded very funny to the young
          lady, but very serious to you? And how
          at the windup he confessed that he had
          himself done such things when he was
          boy, but thought them rude and suggested
          that in future you spend
          een going about restoring unhinged
          gates to their own and t'ie commission
          of other similar good ikeds?
          If that reminiscence be not one of
          yours, then one somewhat similar probably
          is unless yon were a city boy, as I
          was not. I suppose there is no docbt
          that town born lads havo quite as much
          fun in their weak way and manner as
          counrry lads, bet I must confess I have
          never been able to understand how.
          It is not patting it inaccurately, I
          imagine, to say that Halloween, observed
          according to the methods that
          are time honored across the ocean, is a
          new institution, comparatively speaking
          at least, in America. It was brought
          here by settlers who came latter than
          tho Puritans, by immigrants who came
          to better their condition and not for
          liberty of conscience. In some sectiocs
          where the population is largely made
          up of this latter element the old English,
          Scotch and Irish legends undoubtedly
          obtain, yet it is extremely doubtful
          if there is one-tenth of tho Halloween
          superstition anywhere in the
          United States that exists in the mother
          country unless it is among tho negroes
          of tho south, where, since the extreme
          observances of the occasion resemble
          those of the "voodoo doctors" so closely,
          it has been completely assimilated
          into the system of superstitions held by
          the children of Africa.
          A sort of half belief in Halloween
          superstition has been widely disseminated
          by the boarding schools of the
          land, and it is safo to asmno that there
          is far more of Halloween observance
          among the children and young folks of
          the rich and well to do than among
          those whose parents work for wages
          throughout the land. It is quito customary
          nowadays for parents to plan
          Halloween parties for their children, at
          which many of the sports of tho season
          are entered into.
          Bobbing for apples, throwing apple
          peelings over one's shoulder to see what
          initials the peelings will form, pouring
          melted lead into water for a similar
          purpose and the like are favorito diversions
          at these little parties. As diversions
          they are harmless, but in all seriousness
          the inculcation of superstitious at Halloween,
          or any other time, for that matter,
          should be avoided, for the human
          creature is desperately inclined to be
          superstitious, no matter how modern,
          and there is nothing more torturing
          in life than to bo a victim of some belief
          in the significance of omens and
          signs and presentiments, even if the victim
          knows in his inmost heart that
          there is nothing at all to justify such
          belief.
          As a study the folklore of Halloween
          is most interesting. The origin of
          the observance is unmistakably Druid-
          'SisHaB:
          iw.sn S'aUL.
          jn? n isi.
          two nAZL snrrs i threw bto the flame
          ical, and, although the date was shifted
          to that of All Souls' night when Christianity
          usurped heathenism among the
          Teutons, the Anglo-Saxons and the Celts,
          there is nothing about its legends and
          ceremonies that does not savor of the
          pagan. Pulling the kail (or cabbage) to
          find if one's spouse to be will be stout
          or lean is one, and from this no
          doubt came the hilarious phantasies of
          the American cabbage night. Hazel nuts
          and chestnuts play an important part in
          English Halloween observances. The
          poet Gray tells of this most delightfully
          in these lines:
          Two hazl csu I threw Into the flame.
          And tOTOch nut 1 cvb a sweetheart's name.
          ThU with the loudest bounce me Bare amazed.
          That in J flame of brightest color
          As bl&zea nut so marth7p&rtsion grow.
          For 'twas thine own that did so brightly glow.
          In the old days it was believed that
          witches did travel abundantly on Halloween.
          The fairies, too, did then disport
          themselves most friskily, and spells
          then worked that worked no other night.
          The burning bf bonfires was general in
          Wales and Scotland on Halloween, and
          lads and maybe lasses, too, then went
          out masked and dressed in garments of
          quaint design.
          -There were also many games on Halloween
          in other times of which nothing
          is preserved, save in tradition.
          Some of these games were such a3 would
          not be admissible now, for the refine
          ment of those old days was much less
          than that of today, no matter how they
          may have excelled the present in other
          directions. Those games which had for
          their object the discovery of a future
          husband's or wife's identity were naturally
          most popular. Here is a recipe
          for securing an answer to the question
          (apposed to bo most important to every
          girL It is from an ancient publication,
          entitled "The Tree Fortune Teller:"
          "To know whether a woman will
          have the man she wishes get two
          lemon peels. Wear them all day, one in
          each pocket. At night rub the four posts
          of the bedstead with them. If she is to
          succeed, the person will appear in her
          sleep and present her with a couple of
          lemons. If not, there is no hope."
          Here is one from the latitude of Chicago
          It i adapted to city observance,
          but it is not warranted: Fill
          your mouth with salt and run around
          the block, when your true love will of
          a surety show himself.
          Eva Lnvett has put this one into
          rhyme. It is an old favorite with all
          Halloween devotees:
          At midnight lone hempseed is thrown
          (The peeping elrei can see).
          "I sow hempaeed, my love, indeed.

          October 3.1,
          o
          is
          Halloween,
          Halloween.
          Look

          Future
          Spouse
          THE very mention of Halloween calls
          up visions of ghosts and witches
          and all kinds of uncanny things. It
          ls the one night ln the year when
          J^ even the uninitiated, if they are
          brave enough, may converse with
          spooks and hobgoblins, and may also, if
          they try hard enough, send the immate
          rial part of their being prancing through
          space on all kinds of errands. It Is safe
          to surmise that the latter privilege is not
          often taken advantage fot. It is hard
          enough to keep soul and body together
          without hunting up excuses to separate
          them. But the grand object of all the
          mystic rites peculiar to Halloween is to
          find out who one's future spouse will be
          —that Ing a very Important question
          with those who have never had one.
          The most infallible of the many Infalli
          ble ways by which a girl may get a
          glimpse of her future husband is to re
          tire in silence. That alone is hard
          enough, but that is not all. She must lie
          there, speechless and in the dark, until
          Just before the stroke of 12, when she
          must rise and, standing before the mir
          ror, it an apple while combing her hair.
          If she doesn't see her "future" peeping
          over her shoulder it's because she is des
          tined to be an old maid, or she was too
          scared to look.
          Another way that does not .-equire so
          much courage is to write the alphabet
          on twenty-six little slips of paper, one
          letter on each .-lip, and then urn them
          face down in a basin of water. This done,
          go to bed backward and in silence. Si
          lence seems to be the main requirement
          in ail these endeavors to coax one's af
          finity to make himself, or herself, known.
          Next morning some of the letters in the
          basin will be found face up and the name
          thus revealed will give the desired infor
          mation.
          A more comfortable custom is to wet
          tho sleeve of a shirt and hang it before
          the fire to dry. Then lie in bed and watch
          lt until midnight, when the apparition of
          the future husband or wife will' appear
          and turn the sleeve.
          If a girl has two lovers and cannot de
          cide which one to choose, she may let
          fate settle the matter in the following
          manner. Eat an apple and then, naming
          two Of the seeds, stick one on each cheeK
          and bay:
          Pippin, pippin, I stick thee there.
          j stick thee there.
          That which is true thou mayst declare.
          The one that stays tho longest is the
          must faithful lover, and therefore the
          most desirable.
          There la a custom ln Wales on Hal-
          loween of building a huge bonfire, and
          wher. the fire i--: almost out each member
          of the party gathered about it throws in
          a white stone, marked for future identi
          fication, lv the morning a search is made
          in ti.e embers and if one stone is missing
          It Indicates that the person who threw
          it In will not live to repeat the perform-
          ance the next All Lints' eve.
          Many of the customs mentioned by
          Robert Hums are now- obsolete, but one
          stii: in vogue is that of pulling kail or
          cabbage stalk. A young couple are blind
          folded and then, taking each other by the
          hand, they go into the garden and each
          pulls a stalk at random and they return
          to th.c fireside, where their prizes cause a
          great deal of merriment. As the stalk is
          long or short, straight or crooked, so
          shall the future husband or wife be. The
          quantity of earth sticking to the root in
          dicates the amount of wealth and the
          taste of the pith the kind of temper "tie
          must expect. Finally the stalks are
          placed over the door, and the christian
          names of the next two entering will be
          the names of the future husband and
          wife.
          A custom that is quite common in this
          count! aiso Is to ike three saucers and
          fill c:.. with clean and another with dirty
          water.' The third remains empty. The
          part;. wishing to know his destiny is
          blindfolded and led to tie hearth, where
          the saucers have been arranged. If he
          dips his finger in the clean water he will
          marry a maid, but If in the? dirty water a
          widow will knd him to the altar. The
          empty dish signifies that a life of single
          CARPET TACKS SAVED THE SHIP.
          BUT CAPTAIN JOSHUA SLOCUM HAD A CLOSE CALL.
          Captain Joshua^Slocum. in his solitary
          voyage around tne world in the sloop
          Spray, found a new and exciting use for
          carpet tacks. He thus describes an en
          counter with the Natives of Tierra del
          Fuego:
          Canoes manned by -savages from Fortes
          que now came ln pu-teult. The wind fall
          ing light, they gained on me rapidly till
          coming within hall, when they ceased
          paddling, and a bow-*ggcd savage stood
          up and called to me, V Yammerschooner I
          yammerschooner!" whati ls their begging
          term. I said "No!" M»w. I was not for
          letting them know that I was alone, and
          6o I stepped Into the ctpln, and. passing
          through the hold, came -put at the fore
          scuttle, changing my Blkhes as I went
          along. That made two kien. Then the
          piece of bowsprit whioh >had sawed -oit
          blessedness is in store for him.
          Apples and nuts play a very important
          part in the mystic rites of Halloween. One
          way to find out If one's sweetheart is
          true Is to place three nuts upon .lie bar
          of the grate or on the hearth, naming the
          nuts for the loved one. If a nut cracks
          or jumps, look for another sweetheart
          right away, for the one you have will
          surely be unfaithful. If a nut burns that
          Is a sign that your affection ls reciprocated.
          but if two of the ruts burn together the
          young lady making the trial may as well
          begin preparing her trousseau at once,
          for there will surely be an early wed-
          ding.
          Halloween parties must always be made
          as weird and uncanny as possible, and
          any one with original id< ie may give
          them full scope on these occasions. One
          very quaint affair that 1 recall may
          serve as a model.
          In the first place the Invitations were
          most unique* Witches and goblins ran riot
          over the card and the utmost secrecy in
          regard to the approaching event was ex-
          acted. Silence, too, was enjoined,, and
          every one was veiled, and it certainly was
          a very ghostly crowd that gathered
          promptly at the appointed time in the
          dimly lighted hallway. Suddenly the
          sound of a bell -was heard, soft and- muf-
          fled, as If it were high up In an old church
          tower, and as it struck 9 the doors were
          thrown open and the young people were
          ushered into a veritable witches' den.
          Death heads, made from pumpkins, with
          a small lighted candle inside, grinned
          from the mantel, the cornices and the
          most unexpected places. Huge cobwebs,
          In which were monster spiders, were
          stretched across the corners and over the
          mirrors. Immense bats with outspread
          wings were apparently flying through the
          air and great owls glared from every pos
          sible resting place. In the fireplace, the
          grate had been removed and in its stead
          a large caldron was simmering over a pale
          green blaze.
          The hostess and her assistants were
          witches, gowned in flowing black robes
          and crownev with tall, pointed caps. In-
          visible music of a weird character added
          to the uncanniness of the scene. The
          gentlemen were all in an adjacent room
          and tbe hostess, taking a lady by the
          hand, would advance with tier and knock
          three times on the door with the small
          broom she carried. In answer to her
          knock a gentleman would appear, and
          Offering the lady his arm retire to a dis
          tant part of the room. When, in this
          manner, the couples had all been paired
          off the wltchefe wave,] their arms and
          crooned in the most approved witch
          manner and the screeching of the violins
          outside became truly blood-curdling. Sud
          denly, with a crash and a bang, the noise
          ceased and the room was filled with light
          When the light revealed the partners that
          at Buenos Ayres, and which I had still
          on board. I arranged forward on the look-
          out, dressed as a seaman, attaching a line
          by which I could pull It into motion.
          That made three of us. and we did not
          want to "yammerschooner;" but for all
          that the savages came on faster than be-
          fore. I saw that besides four at the pad-
          dles In the canoe nearest to me. there
          were others in the bottom, and that they
          were shifting hands often. At eighty
          yards I fired a shot across the bow of the
          nearest' canoe, at which they all stopped,
          but only for a moment. Seeing that they
          persisted ln coming nearer, I fired the
          second shot so close to the chap who
          wanted to "}*ammerschooner" that he
          changed hie mind quickly enough and bel-
          lowed with fear. "Bueno yo via Isla,"
          and sitting down in his canoe, he rubbed
          his starboard cat-bead for some time. I

          THAT YOU WILL FIND MOST INTER-
          ESTING TO EXPERIMENT WITH
          fate had given each for the evening there
          as a good deal of merriment. At a sig-
          nal from the First Witch a couple went
          Into the outer darkness to pull "kail"
          stalks. Of course they had been prepared
          beforehand and there was not a straight
          one in the whole lot. After this ordeal
          had been gone through by every one a
          decrepit old hag. with a real, live owl
          perched on her shoulder, entered the
          room. On her arm hung a basket full
          of nuts. Passing through the crowd she
          gave each a nut and then.' standing by
          the fireplace, she mumbled some unin-
          telllgible Jargon and the room suddenly
          became darkened again. Stooping over
          the caldron she muttered an Incantation
          and red fire Immediately blazed from Its
          depths. She then tottered out of the
          room, which again was illuminated as she
          disappeared. The nuts, when cracked,
          were found to contain a fortune, written,
          on a slip of paper. For example, "You
          will have many trials until the age of 30,
          when good luck will come to you." The
          nuts for the gentlemen were tied with
          red ribbons and those for the ladies with
          blue. .V
          During the evening all sorts of games,
          peculiar to Halloween, were added to the
          programme. A stick was suspended hori-
          zontally from the celling and on one end
          was a short piece of lighted candle, while
          an apple was stuck *on the other, and
          the whole thing set whirling. A small
          basket was then passed around in which
          were a number of slips of paper. The
          unfortunate who drew the paper with a
          skull and cross-bones on It had to furnish
          was thinking of a good port captain's ad
          vice when I pulled the trigger, and I
          must have aimed pretty straight; how
          ever, a miss was as good as a mile for
          Mr. "Black Pedro," as he it was, and no
          other, a leader In several bloody massa
          cres. He now directed the course of his
          canoe for the island and the others fol
          lowed him. I knew by his Spanish lingo
          and by his full heard that he was the
          villain I have named a renegade mongrel,
          and the worst murderer in Tierra del
          Fuego. The authorities had been In
          search of' him for two years. The Fue
          gans are not bearded. At
          night, March 8, at anchor in the snug
          cove at .the. Turn, every heart-beat
          counted thanks. Hers I pondered on the
          events of the last few days, and, strangely
          enough, Instead of feeling rested from

          amusement for the rest by trying to get
          a bite from the apple on the whirling
          stick. Luckily for the girls, a man drew
          the fatal slip, but before he had burned
          his mustache off the First Witch took
          pity on him and clapped her hands. Over
          the door leading Into the dining-room a
          dark, heavy portiere hung and at the slg
          nal an apple rolled under the curtain and
          went spinning over the floor. "It was fol
          lowed by another and then ether, until
          everybody had one. Knives were then
          passed around and a merry half-hour was
          spent In peeling the apples and throwing
          the unbroken skin over the shoulder In
          such a manner as to form the Initial of
          the future husband or wife, In one of
          the apples a needle was Imbedded in the
          core, indicating that the finder would
          enjoy a domestic or wedded life. Another
          contained a pen. foretelling a literary
          career, and in still another a tiny pencil
          was buried, signifying a life devoted to
          art. In a fourth a small piece of wood
          was hidden on which the word "music"
          had been written.
          A few moments before midnight the
          merry-makers were all taken out the
          kitchen door and separated Into two
          groups, the girls on one side and the
          gentlemen on the other. At the first
          stroke of twelve both groups started and
          ran, one going one way and the other in
          the opposite direction, all to meet at the
          front door. The first couple to reach the
          goal would be the first to marry— not each
          other, necessarily— and the last to arrive
          were doomed to a lonely existence
          When the race was over, the breathless
          feel .laded and worn; but a hot meal of
          venison stew soon put me right, so that
          I could sleep. As drowsiness came on I
          first sprinkled the deck with the tacks
          that my old friend Sambllch had given
          me, and then I turned in.
          Now, it Is well known that one cannot
          istep on a tack without saying something
          about it. A pretty good Christian will
          whistle when he steps on the "commercial
          end" of a carpet tack; a savage will howl
          and claw the alr, and that was just what
          happened that night about 12 o'clock
          while I- was asleep in the cabin, where
          the savages thought they "had me,"
          sloop and all. They changed their minds,
          however, when they stepped on deck, for
          then they thought that I or somebody
          else had them. I had no need of a dog;
          they howled like a pack of hounds. I
          had hardly uso for a gun. They jumped
          pell-mell, some into their canoes and
          some. Into the sea, to cool off, I suppose,
          and there was a deal of free language
          over It as they went. I fired the rascals
          a salute of several guns t when I came on
          deck, to -let them know that I was at
          home, and then I turned in again, feeling
          sure that- 1 should not be disturbed any
          more by people who left In bo great a
          hurry.
          laughing crowd was summoned to supper,
          and there another surprise awaited them.
          The decorations in the dining-room were
          red. even the tablecloth being of the same
          brilliant hue.' Over the center of the
          round table a huge owl. with outspread
          wings, was suspended from the ceiling.
          In its claws it held the ends of four long
          red ribbons, the other ends of which were
          held in the corners of the room, near the
          celling, by bats, lizards and spiders. The
          shade on the lamp was red crepe paper,

          the wedding customs. The suitor takes
          the girl of his choice to some lachergoot
          (confectionery). If she refuses the gift
          that ends the courtship. If not he sits in
          the midst of the coffee-drinking family
          for an hour or more. Finally' he Is left
          alone with the girl of his choice. T But the
          wise tant according to custom puts a
          limit on the length of his visit.- She marks
          the wax candle with a needle, meaning
          that i the visit must only last until the
          candle burns to the mark.
          I s could tell you of many more quaint
          customs, but It was not for: that- I under
          took this task. Rather _to convince you
          that i a Boer girl ls not a semi-savage.
          on which had been applied owls and bats
          of some black material. The punch was
          red, so was the frosting on the cake—
          which, by the way, was crescent-shaped
          and surmounted by a tiny doll, dressed all
          in red. as a witch. The souvenirs were
          also small witch-dolls for the ladies and
          owls for the men, both of which, on In
          vestigation, proved to be bonbon boxes.
          In Ireland, the observance of Hallow
          een assumes. In many respects, a religious
          character. It is a custom In many dis
          My English always surprises people Into
          comment. True, I speak with less accent
          than most Boer girls, having a natural
          aptitude for languages and having trav
          eled so much.
          But the rising generation of Boers are
          ail well educated. Both English and
          Dutch are taught In the schools. Oom
          Paul understands English as well as I do
          myself. Many times when 'playing or
          dancing for him I would forget and make
          some remark in English. He would al
          ways chide -me for it, saying. "I could
          speak English as well as a rooinek (red
          neck— Dutch for Englishman), but I never
          forget I am a Boer."
          Like all Boer girls I am an excellent
          ■hot and I fervently wish that I were
          trlcts to bake what are called "soul
          cakes" on that day, which are given to the
          poor, who go from door to door begging.
          The gift of a cake is always accompanied
          with a request to pray for the souls of the
          dead. The recipient of these "soul cakes"
          is generally very profuse In his promises
          to pray dnd calls down the blessings of
          heaven on everything he or she can think
          of. Another custom is to burn a lighted
          candle in every wind in the house,
          which gives a very picturesque effect
          along the country roads.
          There ls a custom among the poorer
          classes In England, also, or begging on
          Halloween, for what Is known there as
          "dole bread." In several districts a fan-
          tastic arrangement, called "Old Hob," ls
          carried about from house to house, ac
          companied by a crowd of young people,
          singing doggerel begging rhymes. Old
          Hob consists of a skeleton of a horse's
          head, mounted on a broomstick, and with
          a sheet wrapped about and concealing the
          person who ls carrying It-
          Shaw, in his history of the Province of
          Moray, considers the festivities of Hal-
          loween as a sort of harvest-home rejoic-
          ing— a thanksgiving for the safe ingather
          ing of the produce of the fields. What
          ever may have been the original motive
          for this "gathering together of the clans"
          on the eve of All Saints, the young people
          who make merry nowadays have only one
          object In view— to discover, lf possible,
          their affinity, to find that mysterious he
          or she for whom we are all of us con
          tinually seeking. Sometimes these "affin
          ities" are a little careless and don't pair
          off just right, so the boys and girls who
          try their fate on this next Halloween
          must not neglect the warnings and
          prophecies which that night of mystery
          will surely bring.

          more for Its charm upon tradtlon and
          the customs handed down from genera
          tion to generation- than does that fateful
          night of mirth and mystery Hallowe'en.
          Most of oar American holidays com
          memorate historic events within the past
          entnxy and half and consequently can
          not of course, have any of the charac
          teristics of ancient ceremonial. Even
          Christmas has, in Its observance, been
          modernised ont of all semblance of the
          old-tfme celebration. Hallowe'en, how
          •r, not only retains Its time-honored
          significance and long-established ritual
          trot finds Its chief attraction In these re
          minders of bygone periods.
          The festival of the night of October 81
          has a number of different designations,
          though none are so commonly nsed as
          Hallowe'en. The others are All Hallow
          ¦yen, Nutcrack Night and Snapapple
          Night, the latter two being derived of
          course from practices associated with
          the occasion. Hallowe'en derives Its
          most common name as the eve or vigil
          of All Saints' or All Hallows Day (No
          vember 1). From time out of mind this
          has been heralded as a night when
          witches, devils and other mlschlef-mak-
          Ing beings go abroad on their baneful
          midnight errands. By a strange coinci
          dence, however, this same night Is sap
          posed to be devoted by the fairies to a
          grand anniversary celebration.
          The traditions of Hallowe'en also teach
          that on no 4ther night In the twelve
          month do sach supernatural Influences
          prevail as after dark on the final day of
          October. According to ancient beliefs the
          spirits of the dead then wander about and
          In some Instances the spirits of living per

          porary power to Join the ghostly clan.
          Persons who have nad the good fortune
          to be born on October 31 are especially
          likely to be warned or advised by the
          elves on each recurring anniversary of

          and hasten to Bayreuth for Wagnerlan
          festivals «o enrh year nearly the same
          number visit Weimar, the Athens of mod
          ern Europe. Ever since the two great
          est German poets made this place sacred
          with their memories, scholars and writers
          no less than musicians have found it a
          worthy retreat. Dickens and Thacksrey
          spent some time here and George Eilot
          and Madame de Stael Bought Weimar as
          a place of Inspiration. Amalla Winter
          in her charming Weimar album describes
          the many brilliant English and Rus
          sians who came to take tea with Goethe's
          daughter-in-law, and spent the evening
          listening to the reading of German and
          English poetry. An Englishman of that
          day wrote In his diary these words In
          memory of Goethe and the days he made
          golden: "Sad heart why do you awaken
          In me memories of those golden days
          that flew bye so quickly. In the classic
          town on the llm noted for its culture,
          life In the open air and pleasure. Weimar,
          oh, yonr name and Its associations haunt
          me now." There are still plenty of ncso
          elation to delight the thousands of trav
          elers who spend several happy days
          ¦midst these literary haunts.

          Hallowe'en
          A HOLIDAY OF
          TRADITIONS
          their natal day, but sometimes, so It Is
          said, other persons have the gift of con
          versing with the airy visitants on such
          occasions.
          Saint Matrimony is the patron saint
          of Hallowe'en and Indeed this autumn
          holiday Is best known as the night of all
          nights for peering Into the future and
          especially for discovering just what sort
          of husband or wife fate has selected for
          each unmarried participant In the rites.
          It Is this function of the holiday which
          helps to keep Its observance alive with
          the young people of the nation and not a
          few of their elders who are yet youthful
          In spirit. Not only are the mysterious
          spirits that are abroad on Hallowe'en
          supposed to be Infallible In their verdicts
          but it Is also of manifest advantage that
          they demand neither fee nor reward for
          piercing the veil that hides the future.
          The performance of some very simple
          ceremony Is all that Is exacted of the
          curious young man or woman who would
          learn Interesting particulars regarding the
          destined life-partner.
          The origin of Hallowe'en seems to be
          hidden In 'an Intermingling of classic
          mythology and Christian superstitions.
          The plan of making nnts and apples con
          spicuous in the Hallowe'en festivities Is
          traced back to the custom of the ancient
          Romans to hold on November 1 a feast
          to Pomona, the goddess of fruits and
          seeds, at which time there was a formal
          opening of the stores of eatables laid
          up In summer for use during the winter.
          On this same date occurred the great
          autumn festival to the sun with which the
          Druids or ancient Celts celebrated thanks
          giving for their harvest and It was the
          belief of the Druids that 'on the eve of
          their holiday the present Hallowe'en
          it rests In a valley surrounded by moun
          tains and splendid woods of the Tliur
          ingen forests. The air Is refreshed by n
          small river which wanders geutly and
          romantically about the meadows, ami
          woods and again rus'aes on so forcibly
          It must be held back by a dam. The
          town Is adorned with a beautiful park
          and some splendid monuments and some
          very attractive homes. The Hotel Erb
          prinas Is one of the show places because
          of Its historic associations. This hotel
          was formerly a large inn and was for
          ninny months at a time tha home cf Ger
          many's greatest poets, musicians and
          painters. When Franz Llsst first came
          to Weimar this was his only home for
          five months. Here he practised and
          played for many of bis friends and wrote
          many of the compositions whlqji were
          later brought out at the Opera house.
          His bedroom and the room occupied by
          Goethe are the two most popular rooms
          In the House and guests bid high to say
          they lived In tha Lint and Goethe rooms.
          There Is nothing especially noteworthy
          In Its furnishing except the beautiful
          writing desk at which the great musi
          cian and composer wrote. The top Is
          shaped like a Greek; temple decorated
          with mirrors and marquetry wood. The
          rest of tha furniture Is limited to a
          wooden bed, a small table, waahstand,
          •JLOS ANGELES HERALD SUNDAY SUPPLEMENT
          the Lord of Death summoned those
          wicked souls that had within the year
          been condemned to henceforth occupy the
          bodies of animals.
          The people of England have long set
          store by an elaborate observance of Hal
          lowe'en, but even antedating their al
          legiance was that of the Irish. In the
          Emerald Isle It was the custom from
          the earliest days for each household to
          set out on this holiday the best viands
          It could afford, apples and nuts being in
          evitable features of the menu. In not a
          few Instances peasants went from house
          to house collecting breadcake, bntter,
          cheese, eggs and other eatables suitable
          for a feast. Indeed, throughout Great
          Britain bread or cake has long been asso
          ciated with the Hallowe'en feast, and
          even today In many English households a
          cake Is baked for each member of the
          family. An early Hallowe'en observance
          was that of ringing the church bells all
          night long, but a stop was put to this by
          King Henry VIII.
          As hasNbeen said, many of the features
          of the Hallowe'en program In auclent
          times have been continued to this day
          but for the most part tho customs which
          were once ceremonies of belief now
          observed only In jest. Hallowe'en being
          the first of the autumn and winter holi
          days and, for the young people, the first
          break In the school year Is Invariably wel
          comed with especial enthusiasm. The
          circumstance that Hallowe'en Is not a
          national holiday does not In the least
          a large round table and an oblong table
          with gilt trimmings.
          But the furnishing of the roo:.i Is very
          flue to that which the Schiller room
          knew. The small dimensions, the single
          bed, the plain writing desk snd the one
          chair tell better than words the struggle
          and hardships which followed this great
          and talented poet all his days. Very dif
          ferent from the comfortable quarters
          Goethe enjoyed. Goethe's room was far
          more spacious and better furnished. His
          room had two large windows with a bal
          cony commanding a splendid view of the
          old Castle walls with their strange carv
          ings, a small house opposite with a
          strange snn-dlal and the large market
          square. Goethe's bed '.s especially In
          teresting because It Is built In the wall
          and has linen curtains bung before It.
          Tht most elaborate piece of furniture Is
          the writing desk, an exact duplicate of
          the one Liszt used. It Is the U..-t on
          affect Its observance since Its festivities
          are for the most part reserved for the
          period after nightfall when the work-a
          day world is presumably at leisure.
          Various schemes for obtaining matri
          monial forecasts on Hallowe'en have been
          handed down to the present generation.
          The roasting of nuts is an essential pre
          lude to most of them. Some Inquisitive
          maidens nre wont to place a number of
          nuts, each bearing the name of a lover,
          on the bars of h grate or among the em
          bers. According to the ritual If a nut
          crneks or jumps the lover will prove un
          faithful whereas if It begins to blaze or
          burn he hss regard for the person making
          the test. If a nut burns quietly and
          brightly especial sincerity of affection
          Is supposedly Indicated. Similarly If nuts
          named for a girl and her lover burn In
          unTson an early wedding Is to be ex
          pected.
          Apples vie with nuts as Hallowe'en vehi
          cles for discovering the Intentions of
          Cupid. Indeed one of the best known
          ruses, and perhaps the one most generally
          which he Is supposed to hnvi written
          many of his most ardent lqve-letters and
          pints of his Faust. Though many noted
          guests have dined and spent some hours
          in this lan, two other names have made
          the place historic. Napoleon lived here
          some weeks when he once paid a visit
          to Weimar. In the rooms is a large em
          pire table on which he Is suprised to
          have written many Important state let
          ter*. The great painter Mentzel also
          lived here a long time and painted some
          of his greatest masterpieces.
          There Is the same terrace overlooking
          tht garden where Goethe gar* a dinner
          to Prince Augustus; Lieut and others. It
          Is here whispered that he often paid for
          Schiller's supper when his friend was
          short of money. Liszt also gave sorao
          famous dinners here, played for his
          Ruests and discussed his compositions at
          mgth. A stone's throw from tha hotel
          Is the royal park, a beautiful wooded
          practiced at the general time Is that In
          which the credulous maiden eats an apple
          before a looking glass while combing her
          hair, confident that If directions be fol
          lowed explicitly the face of her destined
          conjugal partner will be seen In the mir
          ror as though peeping over her shoulder.
          Equally well known Is the scheme wliere-
          I'v any maiden may find out the first
          letter of the name of her future hus
          band by peeling an apple, taking the
          paring by one end and after swinging
          It three times around her head allowing
          It to fall In whatever fashion It may.
          It must be confessed that some slight
          stretch of Imagination may be necessary
          to construe the position of the paring as
          indicating a desired letter.
          There has been transplanted to. the United
          States from Scotland another means of
          peeping into the matrimonial lottery. By
          this plan the young women go hand In
          haud, bliudfolded, or at least with eyes
          closed, to the cabbage patch and each
          pulls the first plant met with. Earth on
          place cut by the Urn murmuring with
          waterfalls and spanned with rustic
          bridges. In the summer-time the park
          is crowded with mothers giving their
          children an airing and men resting and
          enjoying the beauty of the surrounding
          after their day of hard toll. They may
          well rest here for a more beautiful park
          is difficult to Imagine. Here is seen a
          wonderful canopy of greeu made by the
          over-arching of beautiful trees. Behind
          the trees la seen the frame of the rushing
          waters made gladder by the laughter and
          prattle of happy children. Blending with,
          this modern note are interesting views.
          Going down a steep hill one comes upon
          Shakespere's monument. Anything more
          beautiful can not be imagined. The poet
          Is represented as a young man resting
          on a rock and looking out on the world
          with a happy air of contentment At his
          feet are strewn manuscripts, a Jester's
          doll and a wreath of roses. His exprea
          the root of the cabbage thus selected
          signifies dowry. The shape and size of
          the vegetable denote the appearance and
          size of the future spouse and the taste
          of the heart and stem Indicate his dis
          position. Nor Is all the Hallowe'en prog
          nosticating for the benefit of the fair
          sex. There have been designed for ardent
          swains numerous forms of divination, the
          best known of which Is that whereby the
          smitten youth descends cellar stairs
          with a randle In one hand and a mirror
          in the other, hoping to have the face of a
          sweetheart reflected back to him from
          the glass.
          All the Hallowe'en pranks above men
          tioned and a host of others are intro
          duced as adjuncts of the Hallowe'en par
          ties which now constitutes one of tho
          most popular forms of entertaining in
          this country. That tradition has decreed
          the occasion one of mystery as well as a
          night of jollity and laughter paves the
          way for unique entertainments and many
          quaint conceits In the line of amusements
          have been devised by resourceful hosts

          were ready to play Orlando or Benedict.
          To become acquainted with the people
          of the town one should visit Weimar
          during the week of Schutzenfest. a hunt
          ers festival which lasts eight days. In
          this week of gayety is much drinking,
          merrymaking and target shooting.
          Though target shooting is now consid
          ered as a sport, these sturdy Saxons
          show by their strength and skill that
          they have not forgotten the early method
          of warfare In which their forefathers ex
          celled.
          But there Is so much to see in Weimar
          one can not afford to let ones imagina
          tion ran riot with fancies. A good start-
          Ing point Is the Schiller house. Schiller
          lived on the second floor and the apart
          ment Is very homely. 'It consists of a
          living-room, workroom, dining-room and
          bedchamber. The living-room is the
          most elaborately furnished. It has cup
          boards which served for the keeping of
          books and dishes. In one corner of the
          room Is a spinet and a guitar. In a
          cabinet on the other side are seen dishes,
          rings, letters, snuff-boxes and walking
          sticks, used- by the poet. The single
          wooden bedstead in which Schiller
          brenthed his last 1b placed In the work
          room. It is piled high with ribbons
          which adorned wreaths sent by all na
          tions when he died. As one gazes on
          these faded ribbons ones eyes fill with
          tears and the lips whisper- "They came
          too late. Why did not me world help
          and appreciate this wonderful genius
          when his soul needed their sympathy and
          protection." Not far from the Schiller
          house is the library of which Goethe was
          director for many years. The building
          showed that he was almost as good an
          architect as poet. Not satisfied with the
          appearance 'of the place he remodeled the
          hall so that the pictures, busts and books
          would be in good light without being hid
          den one by the other. There are busts
          of many of the men who made Weimar
          known to the world. In this number are
          seen Goethe, Schiller, Herder, Wetland,
          Karl August, Lavater, Napoleon and
          Madame de Stael. To one side is a large
          room overlooking the garden where
          Goethe worked many years and is sup
          posed to have plnuued and written the
          greatest part of bis Faust.
          Mora interesting still Is the Goethe
          summer-bouse, a simple frame dwelling
          surrounded by a lovely garden and wood.
          i
          and hostesses. Hallowe'en has become
          especially popular at schools and colleges,
          as a brief season given over to the pranks
          of the students. Particularly Is there a
          fantastic observance of the holiday at
          girls' boarding schools and women's col
          leges.
          Novelty Is the keynote of everything
          connected with a Hallowe'en festivity.
          Like as not the Invitations, menu cards,
          tally cards, etc. are bespattered with
          representations of witches riding brooms,
          blinking owls, broad-winged bats and
          pumpkins while for decorative purposes
          there are pressed Into service a variety
          of nature's vivid- hued products such as
          cornstalks, pumpkins, carrots, russet oak
          leaves and green plno boughs. Finally
          the, refreshments, which are an lndlspen
          sable feature, Include apples, nuts, grapes
          and other autumn delicacies.
          Since mystic rites are to be essayed and
          ghost stories and other spooky subjects
          are likely to be among the topics of con
          versation, It Is not only permissible but
          appropriate that there should be no bril
          liant Illumination of the scene of a Hal
          lowe'en party and this enables the use of
          candles set In hollowed carrots or the em
          ployment of Jack-o-lanterns.
          Certain well-known American host
          esses, famous as the originators of oddi
          ties, have given Hallowe'en entertain
          ments in barns and attics and In one In
          stance a cellar was utilised, black drap
          eries and the symbol of the skull and
          cross-bones adding to the "creepy" at
          mosphere. Highly popular as Hallowe'en
          entertainments are, masquerade parties
          of one kind or another and shadow pan
          tomimes have come Into extensive vogue
          In recent years. Some of the games which
          are now regarded as indispensable to a
          Hallowe'en frolic have no significance as
          matrimonial barometers. Foremost among
          these Is the prank of ducking for apples.
          The apples are set afloat In a tub and
          each person essays to catch one of the
          floating prises with the teeth, bis hands
          being tied behind him. The popping of
          corn at an open fire, fortune telling and
          other old-fashioned diversions are also re
          vived for the benefit of the younger gen
          eration on Hallowe'en.

          cauldron bubbles, the chestnuts barn
          upon the hearth, the Hallowe'en cake
          gives up its ghostly prophecy of wealth,
          matrimony or a life of single blessedness, i
          In a thousand boarding schools a thou-
          sand girls will creep down the cellar|
          stairs holding a mirror and a candle as
          the hour strikes twelve, looking fearfully,
          for the reflected face which is to tell'
          them of the future, and in more than a
          thousand apartment houses—where there
          are no cellar stairs—young women will|
          eat an apple before a mirror and hold a I
          candle by whose light they expect to see
          that same prophetic vision.

          very popular with girls, and they are

          Masquerade parties are also popular for
          Hallowe'en, especially in girls' boarding

          dancers cannot he positively known.
          There are so many Hallowe'en symbols;
          that whether an ordinary dance, a cotillon
          or a masquerade is being arranged there

          How to Make a Motoring Veil
          EYEKY one has a motoring veil, and
          many and varied aye the kinds used.
          Few women or girls can be said to
          look really pretty in one of these veils,
          but there are many degreee of attractive-
          Beu about them, and still greater differ
          ences of convenience, which, after all, is I
          the really important point. Some are I
          merely long pieces of chiffon tied on in
          liny way, iind they frequently blow off
          in a high wind, so it is really worth while
          to make one properly.
          An English motoring veil which is i
          satisfactory is made in the following
          way:- Buy two yards of chiffon or chiffon
          cloth and cut it in half lengthwise from
          one ,-nd in a point twenty inches from
          the other end. Hem it across the two
          pieces of the loner end and all around
          the cut edges; the outer edges will, of
          course, lie selvages. Then, where the slit!'
          stops, it must Be closely buttonholed to
          pn >*nt tearing further.
          The upper end may be arranged in two|
          nis. .Lho simplest and easiest is to j'
          r it up lightly, sewing the gathers
          together at the edges; then sew over the
          g.i thers a large Hat button mould covered
          with the chiffon. A rather neater linflatter way to finish this top is with a j
          small thick ring, but it is mow trouble.!;
          In this case the chiffon must be turned
          over the ring like a hem and sewed down, r
          ;iinl as the whole width of chiffon must i
          be .sewed on a small ring it is not very i
          easy to do. Tho effect, however, is worth
          the trouble if one has some skill in
          sewing,
          Tho veil 1h put on with this gathered i

          a cunningly concealed door.
          The witches told wonderful fortunes
          for everybody, and a large witch, who
          occupied a central post, stirred a cauldron
          from which she continually distributed
          favors.
          The gnomes «nd brownies roasted the
          chestnuts on the large hearth, and the I
          fairies danced around their favorite
          teacher and presented her with three
          magical gifts— Italian coral to keep
          off the evil eye, a good luck penny us a
          foundation for her fortune and a pair of
          rose colored glasses, through which she
          might always see the bright side of life.
          These fairies were not the ordinary
          tarletan and spangled creatures that we
          have grown accustomed to hear desig
          nated by that name, but were, as far as
          possible, faithful reproductions of the
          little people of famous fictiou, the creat
          ures of the Irish woods and bogs, the
          Scotch Highlands and the German forests
          as they have been depicted by poets,
          painters and prose writers. It took some
          trouble to evolve the costumes, but not
          as much expense as might be thought on
          first consideration, for many of the cos
          tumes were made entirely of crepe paper,
          and in all of them this material entered j
          largely.
          Black paper was most effective for the!
          witch's costume and for that of the owl
          and black cat Poor pussy had quite a
          difficult time —one of the smaller girls was j
          chosen for this —because the other
          guests at the frolic insisted on her going
          on all fours a large part of the time,
          which, in spite of her gymnastic training,
          was not altogether agreeable.
          EQUALLY amusing is a dance where
          the guests (ill appear as fruits of the)
          autumn. There must of course be
          some liberty permitted in this sort of
          character costuming, for while it is com»
          paratively easy for a properly built young
          person to appear as an ear of corn,
          it is rather diflicult for her or him to
          assume the exact proportions of a toma
          to. A lettuce girl, with full shaded green
          skirts of crinkled paper and some grace
          fully arranged lettuce leaves for bodice
          and headdress, is a most fascinating
          creature, and the grape costume, the au
          tiimn leaf costume, the pumpkin vine cos
          tume, &c, are all most attractive. It is
          usually considered wise for the girl to
          select fruit and vegetable costumes which
          are pretty and becoming, while the boys,
          with their customary gallantry, volunteer
          fur the grotesque parts.
          Squashes, radishes, potatoes and ap
          ples all fall to the lot of the boys. With
          the vegetable throng there should min
          gle a sufficient sprinkling of the tradi
          tional Hallowe'en characters. Nothing!
          could be more amusing than the pairing!

          Vegetale Embroidery.

          now one o£ the most tashionublej
          styles of trimming for dresses. It is easy
          to do and goes very quickly. A girl with
          only a little time to spend on embroidery
          can very soon make a lovely triminiug
          for her next new gown, be it one to weur
          to a dance or a cloth one for the street.
          For a little of the vcan be used on almost any kind of gown.
          It is made either in straight strips like
          an insertion or in the brassiere shape, i
          A young girl's evening gown in some soft
          white material, with a brassiere of vc'yu
          tale embroidery in white and gold, is so
          charming that it will pay any girl to do
          the embroidery. But if she doesn't want
          to do quite »'o much work 1 one little strip
          of it will add tremendously to the beauty
          of the dress.
          The work is done on net with very
          heavy I silk. When the gold effect is
          wanted either the gold tinsel thread may
          be used or a gold colored silk. The latter
          gives about as good an effect and ia
          softer. The patterns used are either
          conventionalized flowers or geometrical
          ligurcs, and they may be either stamped
          <>i> the net or on a heavy muslin or card
          hoard, over which the net is closely
          basted. It is rather easier to do it with
          the net basted on some stiff material, for
          that keeps it from polling up with the
          embroidery stitches, ,but it must be firmly
          fastened before the embroidery is begun.

          also bobbing tat apple* and the game of,
          biting the apple, which, however, are not|
          uecesisarily Hallowe'en sports.

          nuts are then placed side by side on

          That the ever increasing uupunctuality
          among American girls and women is to
          be attributed to the too busy, too full lit*

          The Halloween fairies were giving a
          part jr. Tliero was the pumpkin fairy, In
          shimmering shining yellow; tho apple
          fairy In russet nnd green, tho nut fairies
          In golden browns, and many others Into
          the bargain.
          They wer giving their party In ,the
          hollow of a great big oak tree. The
          friendly fireflies had offered to furnish
          the Illumination, and so many of thorn
          came that there wasn't the least bit of
          danger that their lights would all go out
          at the same time, and If they had there
          were several stow-worms that were more
          than willing to shine steadily right
          through the evening
          Outside, on a low branch of the tree, a
          Undly old owl mounted guard. If any
          of the mischievous goblins or hobgoblins
          ventured near he meant to warn the
          fairies by calling out "To-whool to
          whool" In plenty of time for them to
          mako their oscapo
          Locusts and katydids had been Invited
          to supply tho music Thoy sang over
          nnd over again to the delight of every
          one present And for refreshments they
          had little acorn cups Ailed with delicious
          dew caught that very morning and tiny
          ooJtes of honey made especially for the
          occasion by tho bora who had their hives
          nearby and who sent them with theli
          compliments.
          The fairies made a fairy ring and
          danced around It while the locusts and
          katydids sang their best songs, and the
          glow-worms and the fireflies made the
          Inside of the big tree brilliant with their
          yellow lights.
          The youngest fairies served the refresh
          ments, not forgetting a single llreflv or
          glow-worm or locust or katydid, and tho
          older fairies sat together on little chains
          made of lovely pink and yellow toad
          stools. The pumpkin fairy told of her busy,

          The Origin of Halloween
          The only mysterious festival left to
          prosaic Americans Is Halloween. Its
          origin is plainly Pagan, although the ro
          mantic element has come to us from
          England, Ireland and Scotland
          Around the 1st of November the Druids
          were supposed to hold their worship of
          the sun god, thanking him for the har
          vest. Huge sacrificial fires were TTghted
          In his honor, and kept lighted for days
          This Influence can still be seen in the
          "bonfire night" In Ireland.
          The Roman conquerors penetrated as
          far as Britain, and from them comes the
          custom of using nuts and apples on Hal
          loween. On this night Soman, the lord
          of death, was believed to call together
          all the souls of the wicked. These were
          condemned to Inhabit the bodies of
          beasts for a year, and Halloween marks
          their release.
          This fact or belief perhaps, marks
          the predominance of the mysterious ele
          ment In Halloween frolics. It Is the
          night when witches, elves and evl!
          spirits walk abroad They sour the
          cream, tie cats' talis together and per
          form the thousand and one pranks
          usually attributed to small boys
          Robert Burns In his poem, "Halloween,"
          gives us a good description of the ways
          employed to penetrate the veil of the
          future. Three nuts are placed on the
          hearth. Each Is named after a. lover.
          If one cracks, he will be unfaithful.
          If one burns, ha will be faithful, etc.
          llany maidens ate an npple slowly before
          a. looking-glass. The face of her future
          husband was supposed to peep over her
          boulder.
          Children bom on Halloween are sup
          posed to have the power to perceive and
          communicate -with spirits. Sir Walter
          Beott makes use of this in his romance,
          "The Monastery."
          Ordeal of tho Lighted Candle

          A lighted candle
          should be placed in
          the middle of the
          .room, and each guest
          should be blindfolded
          and told to Jump
          over It Those who
          clear it without ex
          tinguishing the flame
          I will have a happy
          and prosperous year
          ahead, but those who
          fail in clear it. or
          who lenock It over, will be very unlucky
          for the next twelvemonth!
          The Needle-threading Test
          It is very hard to thread a needle when
          seated on a round bottle laid lengthwise
          on the floor. It will roll about In the
          most surprising fashion The one who
          succeeds in threading the needle first will
          be the first to get married.
          Around the Apple Tub
          No Halloween par
          ty is complete with
          out the large tub
          filled with cold wa

          reddest of rosy
          cheeked apples Borne

          and controlled, or
          they may tumble
          headlong into the tub'
          A line should be formed, and each
          should kneel in turn end bob or duck
          their beads down Into the water, trying
          to secure an apple with the Weih. Fre
          quently the resisting apple has to be
          pursued to the wwy bottom of the tub,
          but this makes the game all the mora
          exciting, although the clothes are apt to
          get utterly soaked.
          To prevent this, the wise hostess will
          lay In a stock of water-proof bibs for the
          girts. wY'ja the men shgjld remove col

          The grape nnd poach and pear and apple
          fairies all had good reports to give of
          all their fruit trees, and the llttlo nut
          fairies said that they had not only pro
          vided enough nuts for every child and
          grown-up person for miles around, but
          they had made sure of a supply for all

          They were drinking each other's healths
          In tho little ncorn cups of bramble dew
          when suddenly To-whoo' called tho big

          and stood perfectly still, oh, so terribly
          frightened'
          To-whool To-whoo' sang the owl, and
          each tlmo much louder than before.

          worms stopped glowing and tho lights
          of the flrouies all went out at the ery
          eame Instant
          Fairies and fireflies and glow-worms, lo
          custs and katydids flew all mixed up to

          tree trunk until they reached the top.
          Then out they flew and away and away,
          under tho cover of the leaves until they
          were all safely home and ervery single
          one of them tucked In bed
          And the mischievous llttl sprites and
          goblins and hobgoblins that had come
          stealing up tho tree Just to frighten the
          fairies found nothing nt alt.
          They peered Into the big hollow of the
          oak tree, but there were no friendly fire
          flies and glow-worms to light It up for
          them, so they turned away quite de
          jected and maybo a little bit ashamed.
          Tho wise old owl kept one eye cocked
          open until the last one had vanished.
          Then he ruffled up his feathers, tucked
          his head under his wing and went to
          sleep for the night.
          Hallowe'en in Frolics
          Pretty games belong to Halloween more
          particularly than nny other time of the
          year. Certainly, no other feast offers
          such a variety of them Every country
          lends it epecullar customs, for Halloween
          is countless centuries old.
          "Ships of Fate" Is perhaps the prettiest
          and most romantic game of all Little
          ships are made of half an English walnut
          shell, -with little toothpick masts secured
          to the bottom of the shell with candle
          grease. The name of each guest Is
          printed or written on each boat. A little
          lighted candle Is placed In the stern
          Place these In a tub of water and fan
          gently. Much amusement follows the
          gradual pairing off of the boats Tho
          candle, of course, typifies good health
          Whoever has the candle which burns tho
          longest may expect a long and happy
          life. The boats may bo Improved upon
          In countless -ways and look very attractive
          with the lights shining In the water.
          A new version of the old custom of
          bobbing for apples Is, perhaps, not so
          exciting, but decidedly more reassuring
          for the unfortunate victims who have to
          go home on a cold night with wet cloth
          ing. The apples are placed in a row,
          using green, yellow and red ones al
          ternately. The guests are supplies with
          darts, or tiny bows and arrows. Shoot
          ing a red apple signifies success In love,
          a yellow one, money, and the green one
          health.
          An old English custom Is that of hang
          ing a stick parallel to the celling by a
          strong cord. On one end of this Is stuck
          a large lighted candle, on the other an
          apple. The stick Is then spun around
          rapidly, and the guests are supposed to
          secure a bite of the apple The pleasure
          of this game Is very doubtful.
          Slarshmellow toasting, roasting chest
          nuts, apples, pop-corn, new corn and
          Buch things before the open Are are less
          strenuous and still popular amusements
          for Halloween.
          The Boasting of Chestnuts
          The true lovers' test Is found In the
          roasting of chestnuts. A young man and
          a girl should each place a chestnut on
          the bars of the grate and carefully watch
          their behavior. If they stay quietly side
          by Bide, then the young couple who
          placed them there will lead an easy,
          peaceful life together But If, as Is fre
          quently the case, the nuts hiss and steam,
          then such behavior Indicates quarreling
          between tho owners. Frequently one
          chestnut will act In a wild manner, Jump
          Irg away from the other and hlBslng
          loudly, and this Indicates that the owner
          has a bad temperl
          The Halssin 1la.ee
          Into a piece of string about a yard long
          a raisin Is strung. Two people then take
          each an end in their mouths and hastily
          chew as much as possible. The one who
          reaches the raisin first will be wedded
          first.
          Recipe for Halloween
          Peanut Candy
          For a thick peanut candy boll together
          a cupful of sugar, a cupful of molast.es
          and two tablespoonfuls of butter ery
          slowly for about half an hour Then
          try In cold water and when It Is brittle
          add a cupful of shelled peanuts Pour
          Into well greased pans to the depth of
          half an Inch When It begins to harden
          cut Into squares with a buttersd knife.
          A crisp peanut candy that is easily
          made Is made by melting and browning
          granulated sugar, being careful that it
          does not burn, and then pouring It, when
          it Is all melted and brown, over shelled
          peanuts. When It is cold break It In
          pieces.

          one. If a swet one, add sugar Stir into
          the beaten eggs enough boiled barley to
          make It the thickness of a rich batter,
          then form It Into thin cakes with floured

          fat; turn or hold before a bright are
          Minted onions may be added if ap
          proved. The omelette should be lifted
          w th a spoon or knife to prevent it stick
          ing to the pan. which It will do if it is
          a weil-used pan Take to table as sgon
          as choked Jam or stewed fruit may be
          used with this omelette.
          IDEAS FOR
          Halloween Is a time of rejoicing and
          festivity, and many delightful parties aie
          given to celebrate it fittingly The prob
          lem of entertaining the guests harasses
          many a hostess, and for her assistance
          tho following time-honored games are re
          corded: First In tho list comes snapdragon. This
          game Is a great favorite with the younger
          folks, and even the elders will enjoy It.
          About half a pint of brandy should be
          put Into a dish and a match applied to
          It. The moment It catches fire tho light
          In the room should be put out, so that
          the sole Uluminntlon comes from the blaz
          ing brandy.
          Handfuls of candled fruits, raisins,
          sugared almonds are then flung In. and
          the guests must try to snatch them out
          of tho flames. This causes great excite
          ment and much laughter, and Is sure to
          make the party a success The girl or
          man who manages to obtain the highest
          amount of fruit, etc from the flames
          will meet her, or his, future mato within
          a year!
          Another delightful
          game is played with
          a mirror. The moon
          should be shining
          brightly, and the
          guest must walk sev
          everal paces back
          ward In the moon
          light, holding a looking-glass
          In one hand
          and gazing all the
          time Into the looking-glass.
          If the fol
          lowing verse is re
          peated, the face of

          The Shadow Game
          This is a splendid
          game for Halloween
          A sheet or tablecloth
          KhnuM hfk Htratchecl
          across the centre ofl'l
          the room and a lamp
          placed behind It on
          u table. The lights
          in the room are then
          put out. and one
          player fits at the side between the lamp
          and the sheet The other players
          must then pass In turn behind the one
          sitting on the stool, their shadows being
          thrown upon the sheet They make all
          sorts of contortions and grimaces, wear
          false noses and beards, etc, and the
          man on the stool must try to guess their
          identity This Is a rather difficult proposl.

          An Old English Halloween Custom
          The girl or man who is anxious to Know
          who her or his future companion for life
          will be will steal out on the night of
          Halloween quite alone, and will pluck a
          hair out of the head and cast It away,
          watching carefully In which direction the
          breeze may blow it The future partner
          will live in the direction In which the
          hair blows To make the charm work,
          the following verse should be recited
          aloud:
          "I pluck this leek of hair off my head
          Tu tell wboBie com the one I shall wed.
          Fly. allken tulr, Oy all the world around
          Until ou rwua the spot wlwre my truu lovt
          U found."
          Another game that will cause great In
          terest among the guests is played in this
          fashion: Take three dishes, rill one with
          clear water, the tecond with wattr Into
          which some black ink has been poured,
          and leave the third dish empty One of,
          the guests is then blindfolded and led
          to the table where the three dlsheu are
          laid The guest then dips his (or her) left
          forefinger Into one of the dishes. If it
          is the empty dish he Is fated to be a
          bachelor all his life or, if the player
          oe a lady, sho wid be an old maid If
          tuo flnser Is dipped Into the Inky water

          A HALLOWE'EN PARTY 3S&
          the player wll marry a widow of a
          widower, but if the finger is dipped into
          tho clear water, then the future partner
          for llfo will be young, charming and
          handsome
          A ory amusing game Is played with
          mashed potatoes. Into tho midst of the
          mashed potatoes a dime, a ring and a
          thimble should ba placed. The potatoes
          are then eaten by the guests, nnd great
          Is the excitement n to who will got the
          articles burled In the mashed potatoes.
          Tho one who gets tho ring will soon bo
          married. The ono who gets tho thimble
          will live alono all his or her llfo. The
          discovery of the dime betokens tho re
          ception of a legacy or the gaining of
          riches
          A eplcndld way of entertaining the
          guests Is the hiding of nuts or apples in
          different places In the room. Several
          people should then be blindfolded, and
          they must hunt around for the hidden
          articles Hostesses who valuo their fur
          nlturo and ornaments, etc wil start this
          bolbtorous game at their own risk.
          An amusing game Is tho trial by water.
          The gueet must fill his mouth with water
          and walk nround tho house without swnl
          lowlng or losing a drop of It. The first
          person met of the opposite sex will bo
          his fate. The Idea Is to send two young
          people out by different doors. If the
          young people selected are at all friendly,
          the fun will wax fast and furious, and as
          they are sure to meet, this simple game
          may bring matters to a crisis.
          Apple-Paring Test
          A third and most popular Halloween
          game Is played with applesklns. The
          npple should be pared, care being taken to
          do so In one long, unbroken piece. The
          paring should then be swung around the
          head, flung over the left shoulder and
          allowed to drop on the floor The letter
          thus farmed will show the Initial of Uie
          thrower's future mate for life.
          The Fun of Forfeits
          No Halloween party Is complete without
          the forfeit toll. When a player Is fined
          for the breach of some rule or for some
          mistake In a game, or for being defeated
          In some test, he must at once surrender
          a piece of his private property, such as
          a stud, or. In the case of a girl, a bracelet
          ur biooch or something of the sort
          A ready-witted person is then chosen to
          play the part of the Justice. There Is
          also a collector, who holds out the arti
          cle forfeited, crying, "Who Is the owner
          of this pretty thing?" The owner then
          comes forward, kneels down at the feet
          of Justice and Is told what he must do
          to redeem the goods. The penalties are
          varied and amusing:
          "Leave the room with two legs and
          come back with six The way to do this
          13 to go out Of the room and return carry
          ing a chair
          "Place one hand where the other cannot
          pet at it." The way to do this is to grasp
          the elbow.
          The quick-witted Justice will Invent
          many amusing penalties, and the game of
          forfeits will proceed in a very lively
          manner.
          Fortune Telling on Halloween
          One of the party
          should dress up as a
          witch or gipsy and
          tell the fortunes of
          the rest of the com

          to write the for

          Boms o them black, eome o them green,
          Some o' them llko a turkey Dean.
          Feast days and fast days, holidays and
          festivals come and go, but Halloween
          Is unique. It Is vested with the charm
          of all that there Is of the mystical, the
          strango and the weird and the super
          natural. Evil spirits hold high carnival, witches
          ride the air, goblins and hobgoblins,
          fairies and elves appear boldly, and the
          souls of the dead come forth from their
          graves and roam the earth.
          Even Us origin Is mysterious, pagan
          and Christian with a .dash of the
          mythological thrown In, perhaps. Long
          ago a feast was held in honor of Pomona,
          goddess of tho harvest. In England the
          Druids held a harvest celebration nt this
          time of year and built great bonfires
          In high places in honor of the sun
          that ripened their grain. In the Cath
          olic calendar the Eve of All Saints
          coincided with the pagan festival and
          became Involved In the fantastic rites
          of the earlier celebration.
          It Is a night when It Is not safr to
          be out in the dark and alone, a night
          when any man or maiden has the right
          and the might to invoke the spirit of
          tho future spouse by strange spells and
          Incantations. Faith In maslo Is all that
          Is needed.
          And It Is a night, flrs.t and last and
          all tho time, when grown-up pooplo can
          cast aside the affairs of state, the pomp
          of circumstance, and be what thoy would
          most like to be la all the world merry
          hearted children.
          And If we no longer really and truly
          believe In the supernatural, there Is a
          remembrance of the belief to serve the
          purpose and a wish that la almost a
          faith In Its power
          In a word, Halloween Is romance, the
          Never-Never Land that we are all seek
          ing, Bometlmes unknowingly and some
          times with the dusty highway of tho
          commonplace stretching ahead of us In
          terminably, and blinding our eyes.
          The Rose Test, for Girls
          Choose one for yourself and one for
          jour lover.
          This requires two roses with long stems.
          American Beauties are splendid foi this
          purpose You must try the test in soli

          rose chosen for your lover, twine the
          stems of the two flowers together and re

          "Twine, twine and
          Intertwine,
          Let my love be

          If his heart be kind

          If your lover loves

          may have to beg, borrow or steal a cel
          lara modern cellar, of course, clean and
          dry, with n cement floor but certainty
          thero Is no place quite ltke It for a chil

          tho cellar of Itself puts ono In the proper
          anticipatory spirit! tho usual lioxllko
          stairway, dimply lighted, Is spooky just
          of Itself.
          A cellar, with grinning Jack o'Lan
          terns, giving an orange glow for tho only
          light; with autumn leaves and grasses
          festooned from the walls nnd celling; with
          witches, bats, cats nnd owls cut from
          black paper In nllhouotto and pasted
          against white walls, makes a picture In
          tuno with the weird and mysterious
          forces awake and abroad on this one
          night of tho year.
          A witch's caldron mndo of pasteboard,
          covered with black paper and set on a
          tripod, should bubble over with Hallow
          con favors. A bona fide witch, dressed
          with all the mummery of the part, should
          preside and distribute crackers, rattles
          and whistles to all bold enough to claim
          them.
          There aro games ns old as the hills
          that seem new overy year and never loso
          their charm. Bobbing for apples Is one,
          and a placo for a tub already filled with
          water should be found somewhere In tho

          harmonics prevail, tho color schemes
          shown being chiefly orange, dcop reds
          and browns. Of course, tho weird black
          witches and white skeletons aro also In
          ovldence. One very charming table had
          a cloth mado of orange crepe paper, with
          a border of wltchos and cats In black.

          Auction Is the order of tho daj At
          every hour of the day, and mostly every
          hour of the night, a feverish bridge flend
          mny be seen looking for Its mato. The
          ever-popular tango is auction's only rival
          for popularity. This brings us to tho point
          of card players In general.
          You have all mot the charming little
          woman who has no thought on earth ex
          cept "dear John" and the children
          Ordinarily she Is most attractive, but In
          the serious mntter of brldgo you rattier
          lose your disposition when sho cheerfully
          doubles "Just to see what will happen"
          Such a partner is a grievous trial, but
          aay, with Cervantes, "Patience and shuttle
          the cards." To act annoyed at a partner's
          Ignorance of the game Is out of place; to
          criticize her play is Inexcusable.
          As for the giggly person, who cheer
          ftillj disregards alt her partner's signal
          bids, looks bored while her opponents
          play the dummy hand; in brief, who
          doesn't try at all, nothing Is too terrible
          She should either give cards up entirely
          or pay attention. That Is only fair to the
          other players
          Scientific "brldgers" have been blamed
          for their strict attention to the game This
          Is a very good fault, Those who play o
          game for tho love of It, and not for a
          pair of fancy ghnes or a camisole, can
          easily understand this. Nothing Is "so try
          Ing In any game as tho amateur Ilrldge
          etiquette Is a vei-y well defined thing und
          should be carefully observed by all
          players.
          On the whole. It Is the card player who
          always had a good time, whether he wins
          or loses; who takes defeat like success,
          with a bmlle, who plays carefully and
          wins occasionally: who is willing to help
          the beginner, and who never, never criti
          cizes, who is a favorite at bridge parties
          ties.

          The Pigeon=Post at
          j|| By Adrlen De J;
          IN France, during the siege of Paris,
          at a time when the German
          armies were surrounding the capital
          and cutting off the Parisian
          population from all communication
          with the outside world, Monsieur
          Rampont, the then Postmaster-General,
          conceived the idea of intrusting
          to pigeons the transmission of news,
          thus giving the inhabitants a knowledge
          of what was going on in the provinces.
          In this way those members of

          the Government who had remained
          in Paris were put in touch with their
          colleagues of the National Defense
          who were at Tours. In order to attain
          this subject a certain number of
          pigeons were conveyed by balloon from
          Paris to Tours, whence they were set
          free, bearing messages photographically
          reduced to microscopic dimensions
          on very light collodion films. In
          those days the despatch was rolled up
          and inclosed in a quill attached to the
          tail of the pigeon. By these means over
          150,000 official and, at the lowest,
          1,000,000 private messages entered
          Paris.
          The great French shipping company
          known as the Compagnie Transatlantique
          deserves the credit of making
          the first attempts to establish what
          may truly be styled the seapost.
          On March 26,' 1898, the steamship
          La Champagne took aboard, for the
          first time, eighty pigeons. Three
          batches of birds were set free at a
          6hort distance from the seaboard, and
          this in most stormy weather. The
          older birds safely reached their cote,
          while the younger ones, unable to withstand
          a pelting rain-fall, dropped into
          the sea ill sight of those aboard.
          On the following day, and under
          Ilk infavorable wenther conditions,
          L; 'bampa&ne, Laving covered 3G0
          miles, rescued the crew of tlie doomed
          Bothnia. Seven pigeons were sent

          They took their flight r.t noon, and it
          was calculated that they should either
          reach land or some ship's matt. One
          of the birds dropped on the deck of the
          Chatterton, in the Eay of Biscay; the
          Chatterton cabled to Paris end to New
          York the- loss of the Bothnia. A second
          bird was picked up by a freight
          steamer, which thereupon shaped its
          course for the locality of the disaster
          came across tho derelict, and towed it
          into an Irish port. A week later a
          third pigeon, wounded, end minus its
          despatch, reached its cote. The four
          others were never heard of again.
          The pigeons employed by the Compagnie
          Transatlautique are selected
          with the most rigirous care. The head
          must be big and round; the bill relatively
          short and surmounted with a
          fleshy, heart-shaped excrcscence; the

          bunch out; the legs be short; and the
          wings must meet on a narrow and
          powerful tail.
          In addition to being endowed with
          an extraordinary instinct for shaping
          Its course, a good carrier pigeon must
          possess great rapidity of flight and
          tremendous staying power. The firstnamed
          quality?the "homing instinct,'
          which is innate?is not susceptible of
          any improvement. The two others

          may be secured by means of progressive
          and regular training. A pigeon's
          education begins when it is but three
          or four months old. It is conveyed a

          free. The' experiment is renewed daily,
          the distance on each occasion being
          imperceptibly increased. The bird's
          education cannot be considered complete,
          however, until it has attained
          the age of three years.
          On land the pigeon is able to cover
          long distances, such as those between
          T?r?non nml RriiKHPls or New York and
          Chicago. Its ratio of flight, under normal
          atmospheric conditions, is never
          less than 31.15850 miles an hour, and
          never exceeds 49.85300 miles on a
          long distance.
          The pigeons ~.re brought aboard the
          Transatlantique steamers in wicker
          cages having a drinking trough. As
          soon as the French coast is out of
          sight passengers desirous of sending
          a dispatch are notified to prepare It.
          In pursuance of this object the passenger
          is handed a small rectangular card
          on which ho is to write as legibty as
          possible what he wishes to communicate,
          plus the name end address of the
          receiver;tbe card is then handed to the
          clerk Intrusted with the transmission
          of the message. The clerk put3 the
          different messages into a group,photographs
          then on a plaque to which adheres
          a film, reducing the writing in
          the course of the operation to such a

          flt to do what is expected of them. The
          clerk attaches each tube to the leg of
          a pigeon by buttoning the kid band
          above described. A pigeon is able to
          carry a weight of fifteen grammes
          without its detracting from the-rapidity
          of its flight.
          The loosings take placc in the morning,
          or, if the skies are too overcast,
          at latest before 2 p. m. Immediately
          upon being loosened the pigeons circ'c
          a few times about the ship, after
          which they head straight for France,
          in the direction of liennes. On arrival
          at the horns station the tubes are
          taken off, the lilms extracted from
          then, and the photographic dispatches
          enlarged to their original size. The
          proofs thus obtained are pasted on a
          glazed card ornamented with a pretjy
          allegorical' design.
          It has often been asked what constitutes
          the marvellous faculty of shaping
          its course by the carrier pigeon.
          Neither sea nor mountains nor forests
          interfere with this faculty. The bird
          steers its course as if guided by a conpass.
          As t'.e pigeon flies at an altitude
          of not more than 1G0 yards to 180
          yards it is not aided by its vision, for
          in that case, given the rotundity of
          the world, it would have to soar to an
          altitude of 707G yards. Now, according
          to aeronauts who have experimented
          in the natter, the bird at that
          altitude quickly drops to a much lower
          one. Are they then guided by magnteic
          currents? Are they endowed
          with a sixth sense? The matter remains
          a mystery.
          It is impossible for the pigeon carried
          away by a steamship to note the
          course followed by means of one of
          his five senses, since, during his journey
          by ruil from Rennes to Havre, as
          well as during the ose by sea, he has
          been altogether cut off from ine cuter
          world. And yet the bird possesses so
          accurate a knowledge of the road It
          has traveled that it makes for its
          cote without the slightest hesitancy
          and at a very normal rapidity of flight I

          to be made use of for national defense.
          During a campaign the success of operations
          depends at most times on the
          rapidity with which the commanderin-chief
          is informed of the enemy's j
          movements. To this end use 1b made
          of cavalry patrols and of the field telegraph
          and telephone. But to Insure
          the safe arrival of Information none
          of these means is so reliable as the
          carrier pigeon. Scouts are liable to
          be made prisoners or killed, telegraph
          or telephone wires may work faultily
          or be destroyed. These mishaps are
          avoided by the use of the carrier pigeon.
          In wcr time the role of cavalry consists
          more especially in seeing and in
          reporting what it has seen. It Is often
          an easy matter to see, but to report
          oftentimes attended by difficulties.
          Herein lies the value of the carrier
          pigeon. Troops on the march are accompanied
          by portable cotes. They
          consist of huge wirs cages provided
          with lateral shutters; the cage is transported
          on a two-horse four-wheeled
          wagon. When it is found expedient
          to reconnoitre the position of the enemy
          or surprise its movements a few
          pigeons are taken cut oZ ths portable
          cote and placed In a wicker cago la

          for this service, for they do not carry
          any carbinc slung about them, so that
          the cage Is more easily attached to
          tteir back. The dragoons gallop off
          in the direction ordered, and before
          coming in touch with the enemy they
          commit to a very tfcin sheet of paper
          the result of their observations. The
          .sheet is then inserted in a tube, and a
          little while after" loosing the pigeon
          the officer at headquarters is in a position
          to read the dispatch.
          In order to fight the carrier pigeons,
          to stop then in their flight ana intercept
          the Information borne by them,
          the Cermans have trained hawks to
          hunt down these winged messengers.
          The undertaking was at first attended
          with difficulties, for, independently of
          the necessity of establishing on a large
          scale a system of falconry, the same
          dispatch might be intrusted to several
          pigeons, and hence it wouid be sufficient
          for a single one to escape from
          the talons of the birds of prey to ren.der
          useless'all efforts made to capture
          the dispatch. Moreover, the pigeons

          h-.wk by means of a little Aeolian or
          Chinese-whistle affixed to its tail. This
          whistle sounds as the bird flies through
          the air, and frightens away the timid
          hawk.
          In Germany much importance Is attached
          to the r.se of carrier pigeons in
          time of war, and in the German Army
          greatest oare is devoted tj the
          training of the birds, the officers and
          men being given instruction in the art
          of handling them. In France the
          scouts ere provided with a pigeon
          apiece, which they carry in a little Iron
          case fastened to the walstbelt. The
          holder has a hinged lid, which is
          opened when the bird is to be released,
          and the head piece can be unfastened
          when the bird Is fed.
          In France carrier pigeons are like
          horses?liable to be requisitioned in
          time cf war. Every year owners of
          carrier pigeons ere compelled to state
          at the Mayor's office the number of
          birds they own; while foreigners are
          no longer permitted to breed carrier
          pigeons in the country.
          There are at present in Paris some
          700 owners of carrier pigeons, possessing
          14,000 pigeons, 7500 of which are
          subjected to a regular course of training.
          The total number of carrier pigeons
          in France is 600,000.
          The pricD of a pigeon varies according
          to its pedigree, age and degree of
          training. Some few years ago, at a
          sale in England, seventy pigeons
          fetched $3449. One of the birds, a
          cross between the Antwerp and Brus|
          sels breed, brought $243.

          VISITOR FROM
          A DISTANCE
          Carrier Pigeon Brings Tidings
          From Far-Away Alaska.
          Ben Rowland of the firm of Row
          land Lucier, proprietors of the
          Hoffman bar, had his attention at
          tracted by a white pigeon Tuesday
          morning, which had fallen exhausted
          in front of his place of business. The
          bird made several attempts to fly,
          but was unable to make any distauce,
          and Mr. Rowland easily captured it.
          Upon examination he discovered it to
          be a carrier pigeon and about its leg
          was tied with a silk cord over a piece
          of buckskin a rubber nipple. Inside
          the nipple, carefully rolled in an oiled
          paper, was this message, written with
          pen and ink on a paper:
          "300 miles N. E. Dawson, Dec. 2,
          1904. Bill, the old place, if note is
          received O. K. come at once. Lots of
          gold. Finder of this bird please noti
          fy Wm. Raymond, address 2152 Mis
          sion St., San Francisco, Calif. Signed:
          Jim Orr."
          The pigeon's leg was badly irritated
          from the cord which the message was
          tied on with, and the flesh had been
          worn to the bone, showing that the
          bird had traveled a long distance.
          Mr. Rowland immediately wrote to
          the party mentioned in the message,
          and it is possible that a bit of history
          will develop from the pigeon's visit
          to Havre.
          Mr. Howland had a crate built for
          the bird, which has fully recovered

          RESUMABLY everybody
          B knows by this time that 1
          M B there is a standing offer of i
          raBHF $400 in cash for the man,
          fa-a woman by or girl wno
          HB I finds the nest of a wild plg-
          JL I eon (ectopistes migratori-
          us). otherwise known as
          the passenger pigeon, and
          finds with It the nestling
          birds. In order to get the
          roward the person who makes the dis
          covery must leave the nest and the
          ;irds unmolested and prove the truth of
          if by making a report and giving the sci
          entists an opportunity to verify the case.
          Magazine and newspaper articles lit
          erally by the thousands have been writ
          ten about the disappearance of the
          wild pigeons which once, as it is al
          ways put, "darkened the sun with their
          fiishlE." The members of the biologi
          r.al survey in Washington are specially
          interested in the subject of the disap
          pearance of this bird of passage from
          its wild haunts. For years it has been
          Imped that nesting pairs might be found
          in some part of the country and that
          with proper protection the bird might
          lie restored in part at least to its place
          In nature.
          Recently there was a story published
          to the effect that the birds, wearied of
          Ihe constant persecution which met
          them in the United States, had changed
          tins course of their (light and had gone
          into Mexico and there were living peace
          fully and happily. This story proved to
          in: absolutely without foundation. Still
          another tale was to the effect that the
          pigeons had gone into the heart of South
          America and there finding conditions
          pleasant were leading a non-migratory
          l:te. This tale also proved to be en
          tirely fictitious.
          In all partB of the southern states in
          the winter seasons there are people
          witching sharp-eyed for a glimpse of
          I'ij bird that once was a common sight.
          In Hie summer sharp eyes of the north
          are constantly on tho alert for the same
          purpose, but as 3'et no authentic report
          s been received that the bird of mys-K-iious
          disappearance has revisited the
          scenes familiar through the centuries to
          its ancestors.
          One of the scientists most interested
          in the search for the wild pigeon Is
          ftuthveu Deane, fellow of the American
          Uniilhologists union and president of
          Ihc Illinois Audubon Society for the
          Protection of Wild Birds. Mr. Deane
          ttrJually has given up all hope that any
          living specimen of the passenger pigeon
          rver will be found, but he is as tireless
          otlay as ever in tracing reports of tho
          Iiird's reappearance to their sources.
          The offer of $400 for the discovery of a
          nesting pair of the pigeons and their
          undisturbed nest comes from Clifton R.
          Hodge of Clark university, but $100 ad
          ditional will be paid for the discovery
          nf a pair of birds and their nest if found
          in the state of Illinois. The additional
          reward is the joint offer of Mr. Deane
          and. as I remember it, of Professor Whitman of
          lue University of Chicago.
          Ono of the most curious features of the
          search for the wild pigeon is the mistakes which
          arc made constantly by men who years ago
          trapped the pigeons and were as familiar with
          their appearance as they were, and are today
          for that matter, with the appearance of the com
          mon robin of the dooryard. Reports have come
          to from all sections of the country of the reap
          pearance of tho pigeon, but on investigation it
          invariably has been found that the discoverers
          l;.id seen nothing more nor less than tho com
          mon wild dove (venaidura macroura), or mourn
          ing dove, which is so familiar a bird that it
          serms almost impossible that any man of the
          countryside could have failed to overlook it as
          his constant neighbor and could confuse it with
          iu? much larger cousin, the passenger pigeon of
          other days.
          To give an example of how the search is con
          ducted for tho wild pigeon and how conscientious
          arc the scientists In attempting to verify reports
          cf its reappearance this one instance, taken from
          a hundred Instances, may bo noted. Recently a
          report from northern Michigan reached the presi
          dent of the Illinois Audubon society that the
          passenger pigeon in very truth had reappeared
          in the vicinity of a club house frequented by
          fishermen and gunners, many of whom had
          known the pigeon well in the old days and who
          were certain that in this case they could not
          be mistaken as to the identity of the bird vis
          itors. It was a long journey to the northern Michi
          gan club house, but an ornithologist undertook
          the trip believing in his heart that finally the
          passenger pigeon had been found, for he knew
          that the men who had made the report had been
          familiar with the bird In the old days and sup
          posedly knew the appearance of its every feather.
          At the end of the journey he was told that the
          pigeons were there and he was led out to see
          them. They proved to be mourning doves, a
          bird common in nearly all parts of Michigan
          and In most of the states of the Union. The dis
          appointment was keen, and keener in this case
          because this was one report which seemed to
          have about it every mark of truth.
          When I was a boy I knew the wild pigeon
          fairly well. It was nothing like .as abundant
          ?s It had been in the years gone by, but occa
          sionally small flocks were seen in the vicinity of
          my birthplace in the foothills of the Adirondack
          mountains in central New York. I am sorry to
          say that I shot some of the birds before I fully
          realized the value of giving protection to a van
          ishing race. The mourning dove I know as well
          as I knoxv the English sparrow, and 1 think that
          there is no chance of confusion in my mind re
          jecting the identity of the dove and its bigger
          relative, the pigeon. It is possible, though I am
          not sure that such Is a fact, that I saw the last
          wild pigeon reported in Illinois. Others may
          have been seen since that time within the bor
          ders of the state, but if so I have not seen their
          appearance reported.
          At five o'clock on the morning of a late April
          toy, fifteen years ago, I went Into Lincoln park.

          ar?
          tAypip
          Chicago, to look for migrating birds which had
          dropped down into the pleasure ground from
          their night flight in order to rest and feed. I had
          just entered the park when my attention was
          attracted to a large bird perched on the limb of
          a maple tree and facing the sun, which was Just
          rising out of Lake Michigan. My heart gave
          a sort of leap, for I recognized it instantly as the
          passenger pigeon, a bird of which I had not
          seen a living specimen for at least twelve years.
          Then Instantly I began to doubt and thought
          that my ejes must be mistaken and that the at
          mosphere was magnifying the bird and that what
          was before me was realiy a mourning dove. I.
          drew closer and then I knew there was no pos
          sibility of deception. Before me was a beautiful
          specimen of the male passenger pigeon with the
          sun striking full on the burnished feathers of
          his throat. I stood within 15 yards of the bird
          for fully half an hour and then it left the maple
          and ,went in arrowy flight down the lake shore
          drive toward the heart of the city. I have often
          wondered since what was its fate.
          Theodore Roosevelt is deeply interested In
          the outcome of the search for surviving mem
          bers, if such there may be, of the passenger pigeon
          tribe. Mr. Roosevelt knew the bird when he was
          a boy and in his trips afield he always has kept
          a watchful eye open for a possible sight of a
          specimen of the species now feared to be extinct.
          When Mr. Roosevelt was president of tho
          United States he occasionally went to a wild
          spot in Virginia where he owned a cabin. He
          called the place Pine Knot. While there one day
          he saw what he believed to be nine wild pigeons.
          It would be perfectlj proper today for a man
          who saw as many pigeons as this together to
          shoot one of them one only in order to prove
          beyond peradventure that the tribe still has ex
          istence. When one simply reports the appear
          ance of a pigeon or of a flock of pigeons every
          one doubts very naturally the truth of the tale,
          holding that the mourning dove has been again
          mistaken for its cousin bird.
          President Roosevelt did not have a gun with
          himon the occasion of his meeting with what
          he thought were wild pigeons. If he had he
          probably would have shot one of them. He told
          no one except a few scientists and a few friends
          of his discovery. He knew as well as anyone
          else did that in the absence of the proof fur
          nished by a bird in the flesh it would be said at
          once that he made the common error. No one
          knows positively today whether the nine birds
          which the president saw were or were not pas
          senger pigeons. Every time that Mr. Roosevelt
          has been to Pine Knot since he has hoped for
          another sight of the birds which made him glad
          some years ago.
          John Burroughs heard from his friend, Theo
          dore Roosevelt, that the nine pigeons had been
          seen in Virginia. Burroughs believed the story
          because he knew how accurate an observer of
          nature his friend the president was and is. The
          stories of the pigeons in Virginia led Mr. Bur
          roughs lo n:ake inquiries at once in the counties
          in Xew York state west of the lower Hudson
          lying In the old Une of flight of the migrating
          pigeon armies of years ago. There the farmers
          and the country sports
          men told Mr. Burroughs
          that they had seen pig
          eons that spring, at least
          1,000 of them, but that
          none of them had been
          shot. Mr. Burroughs was
          inclined to believe the re
          port, for tho men who
          made it were old-time
          sportsmen and supposed
          ly knew the bird well.
          However, there is no pos
          itive proof today that the
          New York farmers and
          gunners were not just as
          much mistaken as were
          the old-timers who told
          the story of the return of
          the pigeons to the upper
          Michigan country.
          In The Auk, a quar
          terly journal of ornithol
          ogy published by the
          American Ornithologists'
          union, there recently ap
          peared a paper by Albert
          Hazen Wright on "Some
          Early Records of the Pas
          senger Pigeon." In this
          paper are reported some
          of the first accounts
          which ever saw print of
          the pigeon multitudes of
          the early days. When one
          reads them it seems al
          most Incredible that a bird species which num
          bered its individuals almost, it would appear, by
          the million millions could ever disappear from the
          face of the earth.
          The account of the great pigeon flocka which
          Is most familiar to the people of the country is
          that written bv John James Audubon, the natural
          ist. It seems "from Mr. Wright's paper, however,
          that a century and a half before Audubon was
          born records were made of the immense numbers
          of the birds which were seen in America. The
          earliest writers called them turtle doves. Mr.
          Wright quotes from the Jesuit father. Le Jeune,
          who in the year 1637 likened the American Indi
          ans to the pigeons. "Our savages are always sav
          age; they resemble the migratory birds of their
          own country. In one season turtle doves are some
          times found in such abundance that the end of
          their army cannot be seen when they are flying
          in a body."
          Mr. Wright found another reference to the Im
          sense numbers of the pigeons in the writings of
          another Jesuit father in the year 1671. The ob
          servation was made at Cayuga lake In New iorh.
          state. "Four leagues from here I saw by the side
          of a river within a very limited space eight or
          nine extremely, line salt springs. Many snares are
          set there for catching pigeons, from seven to eight
          hundred being often taken at once." Another fa
          ther of the church in the latter part of tho seven
          teenth century writes of the passenger pigeons of
          the SL Lawrence country: "Among the birds of
          every variety to be found here it is to be noted
          that pigeons abound in such numbers that this
          year one man killed 122 at a single shot."
          Within the last five or six years reports have
          onie of the reappearance of the pigeon in Mis
          souri, Oklahoma, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan,
          Ohio, Pennsylvania. New York and Virginia and
          perhaps from some other states. In no instance
          has proof been adduced that tho real passenger
          pigeon, tire bird of the old time, was the species
          seen. The disappearance of the flocks which once
          covered the sky as with a cloud is one of the mys
          teries of nature. Man's persecution of course had
          much, if not everything, to do with the annihila
          tion of the species, but it would seem that some
          ting else, disease perhaps, must be held account
          able at least in part for the dying out of a noble
          race of feathered game

          The reel showing the animals at
          the water hole was greeted with
          enthusiasm, and each new arrival
          gained his share of the applause.
          The lads were much impressed
          with the bravery of the motion
          picture operator, who for three
          CARRIER PIGEONS HAVE BECOME PHOTOGRAPHERS
          IDFidHANKS
          NOWADAYS, since there are so
          many means of sending' mes
          sages from one person* to an
          other, pigeons, which used to have con
          siderable work to do as messenger
          boys, have been extremely idle and
          have largely devoted themselves to
          sauntering about in the air and adding
          to the beauty of the landscape. But re
          cently It has been found that there are
          other ways of employing these birds on
          Important missions besides sending
          them on long distance flights as mes
          senger boys. The particular new field
          for pigeon activities which has been
          discovered is that of photography.
          These pigeon photographers were
          first started on their mission in life in
          Germany, where a physician had been
          in the habit of sending carrier pigeons
          from his office in the city to a sana
          torium in the nearby country. Medicine,
          pills and powders were put in a little
          satchel and tied to one of the pigeons,
          which carried them from the doctor's
          office to the sanatorium.
          At last one day a pigeon with a very
          Important message was despatched
          from the sanatorium to the doctor's
          office, and although the bird was cele
          brated for Its speed and trustworthiness
          it did not appear at the end of Its
          journey for a month. The same thing
          later happened to another bird, and the
          owners of the pigeons became very
          curious to know what had become of
          them. Finally it occurred to some one
          that since the pigeons are able to carry
          one-third of their weight it would be
          possible to attach small cameras to
          the birds so that when they wandered
          away they would return with a record
          of their wanderings on the plate of the
          camera.
          A special camera was made, acting
          automatically, so that it would take a
          picture at fixed moments. The pictures
          so taken were not more than half an
          inch square. For a great many years
          different men experimented with these
          cameras until they finally invented
          something that was entirely practical.
          The cameras are attached to the
          breast of by straps which
          pass under the wings and hold a metal
          plate directly between the wings in
          place. This plate has two metal hooks
          on which the camera fits «o securely
          that there is no danger of its being
          dislodged even In flight.
          The cameras weigh two and a half
          ounces or less, and their size varies
          never being more than two and a half
          by two and a half by four laches. There
          are many different sorts of cameras
          some of which take panoramic views,
          perpendicular and horizontal views and
          other repeating cameras, besides the
          more common single lens camera.
          In order that the picture which the
          pigeon is to take may be of any par
          ticular place it Is necessary to know

          A GOOD OLD DUCAL GOSSIP
          Duke Max of Bavaria had no greater
          delight than leaning over the counter
          of some small shopkeeper talking gos
          sip or purchasing toys for his great
          granddaughters in Austria. Innumera
          ble stories are told Illustrating his
          character. It H. Goldschmldt, a wealby
          banker of Frankfort, was* once jour
          neying to Vienna. Opposite him on the
          velvet cushion of the first class car sat
          an old gentleman whose dress and looks
          betrayed no uncommon rank. "Are you
          on a pleasure trip?" asked the bank
          er's vis-a-vis. "Yes," answered the lat
          ter, "I am going to visit my daughter,
          who, thank God! fortunately married

          the ball is blown up to the ten mlnnte

          Saved by a Stump
          Up In the mountain district of north
          ern California a farmer set a trap for
          a bear and caught It the very first
          night. Jhen he should have killed the
          animal, but he took a notion that he
          would make It a prisoner, and perhaps
          make money exhibiting it.
          So he got a stout rope, proposing to
          tic the bear's legs in such a way that it
          could only walk slowly. This he did
          after considerable maneuvering, and
          then sprung the trao. But ho must have
          slipped the knots, for no sooner was the
          bear released than it started for him In
          very lively fashion.
          The man immediately ran for home,
          but tbe ground w_s rough, and he soon
          realised that the bear was gaining.
          He could at last hear the heavy tread
          at.llls- heels, and gave himself up for
          lost, when Ha hea*d a crash and a-deep
          snarl, and when be paused at a safe
          distance to look back he saw the bear'
          on the ground!
          The trailing rope had somehow
          caught In a stump and checked tbe bear
          with such force as to break its leg, and
          at the same time hold It fast

          GREAT BRITAIN'S RULER FOND OF PIGEON RACING
          Everybody knows thai King George's
          horse Pintadeau ran fourth In tho Derby
          two weeks ago, but how many know
          that the king won a big race last week.
          asks the New York Sun. V_l y tew, one
          may venture to say, for it was a pigeon
          race.
          King George, like his father before
          him, is a keen pigeon racer. Indeed,
          the royal raring pigeons seem to be
          more successful than the royal race
          horses.
          Pigeon racing is a modern pastime in
          the United Kingdom, dating back hardly
          more than 30 years as a properly organ
          ized sport. Today there is scarcely a
          town or village in the country that bam
          not a lon"g distance pigeon racing club
          of its own. The sport is particularly
          popular In the mining districts, where
          the pigeon has taken the place of the
          fighting bull terrier and the racing
          whippet as the miners' favorite.
          It was about 1893 that King George
          became interested in racing and breed
          ing pigeons. The late King Edward
          had established a small but select loft
          in Sandringham before this, but It was
          not until 1899 that he was successful In
          one of the pigeon classics.
          This was the pigeon Grand National
          from Lerwick to Sandringham. The
          distance was 510 miles 1,705 yards, and
          King Edward's first prize winner cov
          ered the distance at a rate of 1,307
          yards a minute, or nearly .5 miles an
          hour. King George, then duke of York,
          was third with a bird that ilew 1,252
          yards a minute.
          The pigeon loft at Sandringham Is
          built on land taken from the beautiful
          deer park which fills the landscape
          from west to northwest. The famous
          duck pool is situated about 500 yards
          in front of the loft.
          From the loft a magnificent view of
          the surrounding country can be ob
          tained, and herds of deer roam within
          a few yards of the pigeon loft. In fact,
          An English New Year Custom
          The country people in New England
          used to have a great many Interesting
          ways of welcoming the new year, and
          many oi then\are still kept xip. One of
          the things they believed about new
          year's was that If a woman was the
          first person to enter a house on new
          year's morning ft meant bad luok for
          the whole household for an entire year.
          A great many old darkies In the south
          .em p&rt of the United States also be
          lieve this. The English country people
          also thought that when the head of a
          Jiouse entered it for the first time on
          New Year's morning he must have
          something to bring in with him that he
          had not* taken out.

          THOUGH -ulreless telegraphy and aero
          planes may have lessened the Im
          portance of pigeons as dispatch
          bearers In times of war. they have
          by no means ousted them. Only recently
          two pigeon-dealers, one of them a Ger
          man, were arrested in London for bavins
          Id their possession sixty "carrier and
          other pigeons" In contravention of the
          Aliens Restrictions Act; and about the
          same time a German spy was arrested th
          Belgium with pigeons In his possession
          under suspicious circumstances. He was
          found ostensibly fishing by the banks of
          the Heuse, and sitting on a basket. When
          asked what luck he had, he replied,
          "None, the beggars won't bite." Just
          then, unfortunately for him, "unmistakable
          sounds of "cooing" came from the basket.
          What happened to him may easily be
          Imagined. The pigeons are said to have
          been "fairly tender!"
          That these aerial messengers are still
          .capable of rendering valuable service,
          chiefly between forts, is shown by the
          fact that in Germany there are about
          300,000 of these "homing pigeons" be
          longing to various societies, and of this
          number about 8,000 are reserved exclu
          sively for government use. French statis
          tics show that something like 15,000 of
          these birds are kept well trained for
          military service.
          During the Franco-German War of
          1870-71 these pigeons played a very im
          portant part. At first they carried dls-
          patches reduced by photography to micro-
          scoplc proportions on thin sheets of paper.
          Later, all matter, whether public dis
          patches or letters, was printed in ordi-

          These were so light that thousands
          of dispatches, weighing less than one
          gramme, could be carried by one pigeon.
          The films were rolled up and placed in
          a quill, which was then fastened length
          wise to one of the tall feathers.

          to bring down the balloons, and the
          pigeons were harassed by trained falcons.
          A miniature camera is in existence
          which can be attached to the body of a
          pigeon, carried by the bird to a consider
          able height above fortified and other
          generally close upon 10,000 men with
          some 300 officers.

          The apparatus is
          made In two forms, as a single camera
          and as a double camera.
          The term "carrier pigeons" for these
          birds Is now a misnomer; for the "car
          rier" pigeon is a bird of a different type,
          distinguished by the enormous develop
          ment of the "wattles" round the eyes and
          beak. The true "carrier" pigeon is now
          more correctljknown as the homing
          pigeon, homer, or Antwerp carrier. The
          latter name Indicates the origin of the
          breed; for the Belgians are without rivals
          for their admiration for this bird and
          their skill In training it. The iomer is,
          even In his native land, represented by
          several races, all of which, however, pos
          sess the "homing" instinct. These races,
          "Les Pigeons Voyageurs," are bred first
          and foremost for their powers of flight;
          color and marking are of no account.
          Where these factors have been taken
          into consideration for the ends of the
          "show-bench," the flying qualities have
          invariably been lost. Some of the finest
          performers belong to the race known as
          "Smorles" or Liege pigeons. They are
          rather small, and look as though bred
          originally from a somewhat coarse "Blue
          Owl" and a "Blue-rock." The enthu
          siasm displayed by the Belgians tor the
          sport of pigeon-flying is shown by the
          fact that now-a-days millions are annual
          ly sent over the French border to be raced
          back to Belgium. Nearly, every village
          has Its "Soclete ColombopMle." The sport
          began In 1818 with a match of 600
          miles. In 1823 the first race from Lon
          don to Belgium was flown. The annual

          How War Has Turned Pigeons Into Photographers.
          Thuuuh wireless telegraphy
          and aeroplanes may have les
          sened the Importance of
          pigeons as dispatch-bearers in times
          of war, they have by no means
          ousted them Only a few days since
          two pigeon dealers., one of them a
          German, were prrested m London
          for having in their possession sixty
          "carrier and other pigeons" in con
          travention of the Aliens Restriction
          Act. and about the same time a Ger
          man spy was arrested in Belgium
          with pigeons In his possession under
          circumstances which left no room
          for doubt thai they were to be
          used to further his nefarious ends.
          Now that armies actually can
          make use of trained pigeons as pho
          tographers. these birds are in the
          way of becoming important factors
          In war A miniature Camera Is now
          manufactured for this purpose. Sus
          pended by straps beneath the bird's
          breast, its lens is directed downward
          while the flight continues, its ac
          tion is, of course, automatic, gov
          erned by a turning mechanism
          which causes a roll of film to be ex
          posed at regular internals.
          The pieoon photographer flying
          abovp the enemy's lines in daytime
          brings home on a tiny roll of Aim a
          picture record of all that was be
          neath' its flight?details of the ene
          my's position and strength in men
          and guns
          The possibilities of pigeon photog
          raphy in war were recognized in
          Germany some time ago. Experi
          ments were made under army super
          vision They were successful, views
          of parks, rivers and bridges and city
          streets of quite remarkable distinct
          ness being developed from the ex
          posed portions of fllm-rolls brought
          back by the pigeon camera-carriers.
          That these aerial messengers are
          still capable of rendering valuable
          service, chiefly between forta, Is
          shown by the fact that in Germany
          there are about 300,000 of these
          "homing pigeons," belonging to va
          rious societies, and of thla number
          about 8,000 aro reserved exclusively y
          for Government uga.
          during the Franco-German-War of
          1870-71 these pigeons played a very
          Important part. At first they carried
          dispatches reduced by photography
          to microscopic proportions on thin
          sheets of paper Later, all matter,
          whether public dispatches or letters,
          were printed In ordinary type trans
          ferred and reduced by mtcro-photog
          raphy 'o thin films of collodion mean*
          uring at?out two Inches by one.
          These wore so light that thousands
          of dispatches, weighing less than
          one gramme, could bo carried by one
          pigeon
          The films were rolled up and
          placed in a quill, which was then
          fastened lengthwise to one of the
          tail feathers. Arriving in Paris, the
          ntn was flattened out, and tho
          printed mutter was thrown on a
          screen by lantern and copied
          Later sensitive paper replaced tho
          screen, so that the labor of copying
          was saved The cost of sending mes
          sages was high, as may be Judged
          from the fact that tne postal fees
          on a single dispatch would often
          amount to more than $500,000. Each
          dispatch was repeated, sometimes
          twenty or thirty times, till acknowl
          edged by balloon post, which brought
          back the birds for anotner Journey.
          The Gormans' spared no effort to
          fruBtrat these sources of informa
          tion. Krhpp made special guns to
          bring down (he balloons, and the
          pigeons were harassed by trained
          falcons.
          The term "carrier ptgpons" for
          these birds is now a misnomer, for
          the "carrier" pigeon Is a bird of a
          different type- distinguiBned by the
          enormous development or the "wat
          tles" round the eyes and beak. The
          true "carrier" pigeon Is now more
          correctly Known as the homing
          pigeon, homer, or Antwerp carrier
          The latter name indicates the origin
          of the breed, for the Belgians are
          without rivalR for their admiration
          for this bird and their skill in train
          ing it The home' ;h even in his na
          tive land, represented .by several
          races, all of whtch however, possess
          the "homing" instinct. Those races,
          "Les Pigeons Voyageurs," are bred
          first and foremost for their powers
          of flight, color and marKlng are of
          no account.
          The speod of some of these birds
          averaged 1,250 yards a minute, but to
          day this has been Increased to 1.83G
          yards a minute. The speed, of course,
          depends much on tho state of the
          weather, In a race between Montar
          giB.and Brussels, In_J876, in bright,
          clear weather, all the prize-winnera
          made the Journey of 270 miles in
          three hours and a quarter. Over the
          samo course in i$77> in thick, stormy
          weather, thirty hours elapsed before
          the first bird arrived.
          Tiiat the homing pigeon possesses
          an extrairdinarily acute sdnse of di
          rection ti be no question. A
          ease is on of a bird bought tn
          Brussels and breMght over to Eng
          land. where it remained in close con
          finement for several months. Then,
          one line day,' It was liberated for ex
          ercise. It at once made off, and in
          a few hours was back in its toft in,
          Brussels, having travelled over 400
          miles of country which it had never
          seen before. As a rule, however,
          these birds are carefully trained, the
          initial stages beginning at the age
          of about four months. By the end
          of the first year a flight of one hun
          dred miles can be successfully per*
          formed. But longer flights are per-*
          formed only by fully matured \rfrds.
          of at least three years old. It is a
          mistake, however, to suppose, as
          some do. that they will fly at night
          or in a fog. They roust always have
          a clear view,.

          pigeons discloses tho Interesting
          fact tlul these winged messen
          gers have proved themselves so useful
          and so trustworthy that they cannot be
          supplanted even by such up to tho min
          ute devices for conveying Information

          and the aeroplane, all of which are
          freely used by all tho forces In the Held,
          Indeed, notwithstanding the wonderful
          progress that has been made In modes
          of conveying Intelligence the homing
          Pigeon will be more extensively used In
          the present conflict than In any other
          recorded In history. At least prepara
          tions have been going on for years to
          this end, For the first time pigeons
          drilled as carefully and as persistently
          ns any other part oi ,hc military estab
          llshment will be tried in war-
          England.

          From thu earliest times recorded in
          history the homing pigeon's wonderful
          faculty of getting home In a hurry has
          been utilized In conveying messages, In
          the days of the Pharoahs navigators
          sailing to Egypt used to release pigeons
          with messages to let tho folks know
          they wero coming home. In tho seventh
          century thu Arabs maintained a regular
          pigeon post. Pigeons also rendered val
          liable -services to tho Dutch at the slego
          of Leyden In 1571.
          But It took the slego of Paris during
          the Franco-Prussian war forty-four
          years ago to establish fully tho valuo ol
          tho homing pigeon ns a messenger.
          During the slego seventy-four balloons
          ascended carrying pigeons to Tours and
          other points. It was estimated that 800
          pigeons were sent from tho provinces
          to Paris during thu siege, nnd that tho
          total number of messages carried by
          these winged messengers would make a
          library of 600 volumes. Barreswill nnd
          Dagron developed a process of micro
          photography by which 2.000 to 3,000
          letters could be photographed on a film
          two niches long nnd nn Inch and a half
          wide. Tho messages were read by plac
          ing them In a stereoptlcon and throwing
          them on a screen. Upward of 40,000
          Hii'ii messages were sent during tho
          siege.
          So entirely successful was the pigeon
          post that one of the first things' Bis
          marck did nftcr the treaty of peaco
          was signed was to establish n pigeon
          loft la Berlin fur the use of the army.

          European Armies Have Developed
          Birds as Bearers of Despatches
          to a Remarkable Degree
          By 1874 there wero military pigeon lofU
          at Cologne, MeU, Strassburg and
          Baden. Thu Emperor gave prizes to
          eticourago the sport of pigeon racing.
          Ten years' after the war thero wero
          no fewer than 178 private homing
          pigeon societies In Germany owning a
          total of 52,240 pigeons, exclusive of the
          military flocks.
          Evtry nation In Europe look up the
          breeding nnd training of homing pigeon
          for use In tlmo of war. Italy followed
          next after Franco and Germany In 1876,
          At the present time Italy has sixteen
          military pigeon lofts. Russia has live
          military pigeon lofts. Spain has a mag-
          m
          nlflcent military pigeon system with
          eighteen lofts scattered at advantageous
          points throughout tho kingdom; l'or
          tugal has fourteen military lofts, Aus
          tria seven, Switzerland four, Sweden
          and Denmark each have several, HoN
          land has no military pigeon lofts, but tho
          Government encourages the breeding
          and training of homing pigeons, and the
          fame of the Dutch pigeons Is world
          wide, In Belgium, where pretty much
          everybody keeps homing pigeons, Hy
          ing them in races may be called the
          national pastime.
          During our own llttlo war with Spain
          the homing pigeon rendered Important
          service In carrying messages from the
          blockading fleet In Cuban waters, Even
          Japan has taken to breeding homing
          pigeons for military use. Without
          doubt some of these pigeons' will see
          service In tho Impending campaign In
          he Shantung peninsula.
          Naturally, after rendering such distin
          guished services during the memorable
          Siege of tho French capital, the hom
          ing pigeon Is especially prized In
          France. It was Inspiration rather than
          forethought that placed tho pigeons nt
          tho service of the Government In 1871.
          At that time thero were no military pig
          eons, either In Franco or elsewhere. But
          some citizens of Paris by the merest
          chanco had some pigeons, and It
          occurred to them that they might
          bo utilized. They wero offered to
          tho Government and promptly nc
          cepted. it was six years after
          tho war beforo France set nbout the or
          ganization of a military pigeon system,
          Now thero are twenty-eight military
          ions, cnieuy aiong wo eastern boundary.
          In the vicinity of tho present conflict,
          with about a hundred birds stationed nt
          each, besides ten thousand In Paris.
          Throughout Franco thero are a hundred
          thousand homing pigeons In the hands
          of private owners which tho Govern
          ment Is empowered by law to com
          mandecr In caso of need.
          Tho breeding nnd training of tho
          pigeons nro under tho care of tho En
          glneer Corps. Tho utmost enre. to say
          nothing of affection, Is lavished on tho
          birds by tho soldiers, who become very
          fond of their feathered comrades, Tho
          pigeon houses nro placed facing tho
          northeast, -which Is opposite tho direc
          tion from which tho worst rains come.
          Tho averngo llock consists of about a
          hundred birds, each of which receives
          daily rations of an ounce and a half of
          peas, beans and vetches, divided Into
          three meals, with unimited mortar, salt
          sand and oyster shells to aid In digestion
          As soon as they can lly, which Is when
          they aro about live weckB old, their
          training begins, to routlnuo throughout
          their useful life, which averages about
          fifteen years, Great care Is taken to
          prevent them from perching on any
          thing when they aro taken out for their
          first flights, Those that do alight on
          neighboring roofs or trees are shot with
          out mercy. The command to lly la given
          in
          by shouting or clapping tho hanJs,
          signal to return Is a whistle.
          As soon as tho young pigeons l
          acquired confidence In their wings i
          nre taken a couple of kilometers fr -i,
          homo and released. The dlstatn e
          Increased dally to 300 kltume.i
          on tho thirty-fourth day. After t...

          can find its way homo from any pu.nt
          of tho compass from a distance
          300 kilometers, It Is exercised da
          morning and afternoon, except wl n
          thero Is rain, snow or fog. Cur
          records aro kept of each bird's p. -formancc.
          Celluloid bands giving
          bird's number, corps to which attai I
          and Its home loft arc attached t

          Despatches are written on str.p

          the French army two methods of
          tachlng tho message to the pigeon
          used. In one a goosequllt nn Inch a
          a half long la slipped over one -.f
          tall feathers, then the message
          sorted and held In place by a
          wooden plug. Tho other method

          the message to one leg.
          maintain that the best way Is to u.--
          strip of very thin strong papf-r
          Inches long by three-fourths of an
          wide, which Is simply rolled about i
          leg and held In place by a rubber bar l
          When a message Is attached to a
          feather so as to annoy the bird he
          likely to alight and pull the fej".
          with Its message out and then go nn
          Any ordinary homing pigeon can Sc
          rolled upon to cover a flight of 2.n
          miles In five to seven hours. A few
          can make 500 to 600 miles. Some of
          the finest records have been made b
          American birds. One of these remark
          able birds, named Nym, owned by J R
          Husson of Cresson, Pa., made the flight
          of 243 miles between New York and
          Its home town In 237 minutes n 1'
          which figures out at the rate of a milo
          in 53'4 seconds. The fastest trains
          make the run of ninety miles between
          New York nnd Philadelphia in i
          hours, at an average speed of fnrty
          flve miles an hour. Two railroads run
          out the time between New York a- I
          Chicago to twenty hours, the dlstanc
          In one instance being 912 miles, in
          another 948 miles, which also is sub
          stantially forty-five miles an hour.
          The average speed of these trains w:i
          maintained by Francisco, a h.imln,
          pigeon owned by L. Walfelcar of H -boken
          in 1879 for the distance of 37'.
          miles br.ween Steubenvllle, Ohio, an I
          New York. Indeed, Francisco did i
          trifle better, for he covered the distant
          In eight hours and eight minutes.
          course the speed Is much less than tha
          madet by Nym, but the distance wn
          greater and tho wind, which serloush
          affects a pigeon, not so favorable.
          Another famous flight was made b
          Ned Damon, owned by T. F. Goldman
          of Brooklyn In 18S3. Ned covered th
          distance of 508 miles from Abingdon.
          Va.. In 14 hours and 25 minutes, whlc
          was an average of a little more than
          thirty-five miles an hour.
          Atlanta, owned by Samuel Hunt
          Fall River. Mass., made the flight fr -m
          Jonesboro, Tenn., to his master's horn,
          n distance of 715 miles. In nine days In
          1S85. The longest flight recorded for
          homing pigeon was from Montgomery.
          Ala., .to Fall River, 1,040 miles, made In
          1S85 by Alabama, also owned by Mr
          Hunt. Alabama was twenty days on
          tho road.
          The marvellous feature of the flight i

          almost supernatural Intelligence of tb
          homing pigeon has Interested sclen:!- -for
          years. All sorts of theories h.n
          been advanced to account for It. T!-'
          latest theory Is that of a French sa.m
          who afttr long and elaborate study, o'
          servatlon and experiments, has sue
          cecded In convincing himself, at lea
          that the homing pigeon Is guided so'..
          by Its wonderful vision. This explau -tlon
          may answer in the case of plge
          elaborately trained over gradually I
          creasing distances for nearly tho range
          of their flight, but it falls utterly
          Alabama's case, This pigeon never
          more -than an Inconsiderable fraction

          turned loose at Montgomery to find

          to maintain that Alabama could st-
          thousand miles.
          Tho most reasonable explanation
          that made by a French scientist w
          after a series of experiments conis:
          of 'tho elimination or deadening of

          SINCE tho days of Pharoah the
          carrier pigeon has played an
          Important part in warfare. De
          spito tho perfection of tho wired
          W and wireless telegraph and telephone,
          V wig-wagging and other means of
          j transmitting messages from head
          quarters to flcld commanders, nothing
          has yet been invented, unless it is tho
          aeroplane, that makes these means of
          communication absolutely safo from
          I prying eyes and ears. Therefore, now
          j as heretofore, the crmics of the world
          i rely upon tho carrier pigeon as tin
          J j safest and surest means of communl
          'A I cation whoro absolute secrecy is os
          i sentlal.
          I While other nations of tho world,
          j especial. Gormany, Italy'and Prance.
          I havo devoted years of careful study
          i to the broedlng and training of horn
          i 1 ing pigeons, It has only been reccnt
          r ly that tho United States deemed it
          necessary to look for theso winged

          messengers to accompany our various
          expeditionary forces to France. There
          arc soveral cotes of theso swift and In
          telligent birds now under Army juris
          diction, and already many of theso
          pigeons havo been transported across
          seas. Tho best known of theso cotes
          is at Lansdownc, Pa., where that well
          known Philadelphia sportsman, An
          thony J Drcxol Blddlc, now a Captain
          In tho United States Marino Corps, is
          devoting much tlmo to supervising
          tho training of the birds.
          Record Breakers In Flock.
          In this coto are many birds that
          hold records for speed and distance
          flights. Charles Jones, presldont of
          tho National Carrier Pigeon Associa
          tion, has taken a keen Interest In tho
          new army flock and turned over two
          of his record breaking birds, "Undo
          Sam" and "Botty. "Uncle Sam"
          still holds the record for an over
          sea flight of 500 miles, while "Betty's"
          600-inllo straightaway flight never
          has been equalled.
          It is generally conceded that tho
          safest way to conceal a message to be
          borno by a carrier pigeon is to en
          fold It in a little tube that is tuckod
          beneath tho bird's wing. Sometimes
          tho noto is tied to its leg, or about
          Its neck, but the tubo is moro popu
          lar. When a homing pigeon is re
          leased for its home flight It generally
          soars to a tremendous altitude in
          order to get its bearings. When It
          has established its sense of direction
          it darts away in straight flight to Its
          goal, or cote. As tho bird flies bo
          swiftly and at such a great altitude
          tho chances of Its being shot by an
          enemy sharpshooter Is romoto In ths
          extreme and for this reason tho
          chances for Its bringing homo tho
          messago with trhlch it was entrusted
          aro excellent
          Birds Used By Pershinp:.
          Uncle Sam's birds will bo exten
          sively used onco tho American "Sam-
          A
          mies" get Into action and no doubt
          General Pershing and his staff al
          ready havo had occasion to uso them.
          In the American coto are birds that
          are tho progeny of "Simny.JJm." one
          of the most noted homing birds In the
          world. Jim electrified the homing
          fanciers of tho world a few years ago
          by a flight from Rio dc Janoiro to
          Jeannctte, Pa a distance of 4,200
          miles. It was tho flrst time a bird
          of its kind ever winged Us way from
          a point south of tho Equator. Jim
          was liberated at Rio on May S, 1913.
          Twenty-four hours afterwards ht re
          turned to tho point of liberation, cir
          cled about the cote for an hour or so
          land then headed due north. Whether
          it was tho intenso heat, or tho great
          distance, most of which was ovor
          strange and unfamiliar surroundings
          abounding In denso tropical foliage,
          none knows, but in any event Sunny
          Jim did not return to this Pennsyl
          vania cote until twenty-four days after
          his liberation in the tropics. Bu' tho
          all important point is, ho arrived.
          Whereas tho natural instinct of tho
          carrier pigeon is to seek his cote the
          moment ho is liberated at some dis
          tant point, nevertheless tho armies
          of tho worid aro not relying on in
          stinct alone. Theso birds aro train
          ed Just as diligently and assiduously
          as any other part of the wonderful
          units that aro being so masterfully
          weldod Into a perfect war machine.
          The training is only accomplished af
          tor weeks and months of patient effort
          and now that tho time has arrived
          for our army to tako its placo in tho
          foreign battio line, great faith Is ho
          ling pinned to tho feathered tribe that
          is being transported across tho seas.
          Dates Back to Pliaroah.
          The part tho homing pigeons played
          in the affairs of the world as previous
          ly stated, dates back to tho days when
          Pharoah's navigators wero sailing to
          Egypt and released these homing
          birds to let those at homo know tho
          dato of their expected return. In tho
          seventh century, history tells us, the
          Arabs maintained a regular pigeon
          posu Tho burdens of tho Dutch dur
          ing tho sicgo of Leyden, wore mate
          rially lightened by tho swift, flying
          pigeons which conveyed their mes
          sages and kept the lines of communi
          cation open and safe.
          Tho real valuo of tho homing pig
          eon In war was best demonstrated
          during tho slego of Paris in the Franco-Prussian
          war, Just forty-four, years
          ago. In tho course of this slego seventy-four
          balloons were sent aloft all
          frolghtcd with homing pigeons which
          wero destined for Tours and other
          points. It is said that upwards of
          800 pigeons wero sont from tho Prov
          inces to Paris during the slego and
          that tho momentous messages they
          conveyed would make a library of
          500 volumes. It was Just prior to tho
          siege that Barreswill and Dragon per
          fected a process of mlcrophotography
          by which two to three thousand letters
          could bo photographed on a film two
          Inches long by an inch and a half
          wide. By placing tho negative or
          positives In a storeopticon and throw
          ing them on a screen, tho messages
          Could easily bo read. More than 40,
          000 such messages wero sont whllo
          tho slego lasted.
          Pigeon Post For Berlin.
          Immediately after signing tho
          treaty of peace Bismarck, realizing
          tho importanco of a plgoon post In
          war times, issued orders for estab
          lishing cotes of tho best birds obtain
          able In Berlin. 

          Germany's army has been using
          the homing pigeon to a considerable
          extent ever sinco. By IS 74 thero we:o
          official pigeon cotes established at Co
          logne. Metz, Strassburg and Baden.
          To stlmulato the interest in broed
          lng homing pigeons tho Kalsor gave
          annual prizes for the swiftest and
          strongest birds and ten years after
          tho war thero wero ITS private hom
          ing pigeon societies In Germany own
          ing a total of 62,24 0 birds, cxcluslvo
          of thoso In the army cotes.
          Germany's Interest in the homing
          pigeon was a stimulus to that In other
          countries. Italy followed tho ex
          ample set by France and Germany
          and her cotes ever since havo been
          world renowned. Sho now has six
          teen army lofts, all filled with tho
          very highest type of birds that brood
          ers can produce. Russia has five of
          theso military lofts and this means
          several thousand birds, to say nothing
          of the new crop of young birds that
          annually come on, for tho pigeon is
          prolific as a breeder.
          Spain Uas Fine Ixfts.
          Spain has a magnificent collection
          of homing pigeons and its official lofts
          are among tho finest in the world. Its
          eighteen lofts, all under military su
          pervision, aro scattored through tho
          kingdom with a trainod body of sol
          diers to look after and train tho birds.
          Portugal,. llko her neighbor, has gono
          In scientifically for pigeon breeding
          and uses them extonslvoly for army
          and sccrot scrvlco purposes. Portu
          gal has fourteon lofts; Sweden and
          Denmark flvo each. Holland has no
          But all said and dono France leadB
          tho world In tho utilization of tho
          carrlor pigeon. Thero aro upwards
          of 100,000 birds in the hands of skilled
          breeders and trainers throughout that
          Republic, all of which aro subject to
          bo commandeored by tho government
          at an Instant's notice. As It Is France,
          learning tho. value of theso winged
          mossengers in the Franco-Prussian
          war, now has twenty-eight military
          pigeon lofts, most of them along tho
          eastern boundary in tho vicinity of tho
          battle front- There are 100 birds in
          each of tnese lofts.
          French scientists after a series of
          exhaustlvo experiments have decided
          that tho homing pigeon relics upon tho jH
          sense of smell, rather than that of
          sight, to find its way home. This do
          clslon was reached after testing every
          sense theso birds aro endowed with.
          Tho senses of sight, hearing and smell
          wero all deadened In turn. First tho
          birds wero turned looso far from
          home and blindfolded. They arrived
          at their cote according to schedule.
          Then their ears wore scaled with wax fM
          and still they arrlvod. But when their
          nostrils were closed with wax tho
          birds becamo bewildered and helpless JM
          and floundered around, soon refusing
          to fly at all. Tho scientist's cxplana- IH
          tlon is that each locality has its indl
          vidual odor for tho homing pigeon,
          and by circling aloft the pigeon final
          ly gets into tho air current frolghted
          with tho odor of tho pigeon's home lo
          callty and by following this curront
          ho arrives ultimately at his cote.
          230 Miles In Five Hours. j IH
          A flight of 250 miles in from flvo to
          soven hours is regarded as an ordi-
          nary feat for a pigeon. A fow can
          make 500 or 600 miles In tho satao
          time. Somo of tho best records over
          attained wero hung up by American
          birds. A bird namod Nym, owned jH
          and bred by J. R. Husson of Cresson.
          Pa., flew from Now York City to
          Cresson, a distance of 243 miles, in JH
          337 minutes. That was away back in
          1SS0. The bird's avcrago speod wa3
          at tho rato of a mllo in 5S V seconds.
          In a flight from New York to Stouben- jH
          vllle, Ohio, or a dlstanco of 375 miles,
          San Francisco, owned by a Hobokon.
          N. J., man maintained an avcrago of
          fifty miles an hour. A record which
          long stood was that from Montgomory,
          Ala., to Fall River, Mass.. 1040 mllos,
          made by Alabama, a noted bird. Tho
          pigeon was in his loft ten days after
          liberation. IH

          means of communication failed.
          I'ari'ier pigeons are not only used by the In
          fantry and the navy, but are used fieiptently by
          the air urn lee. At the Dunkirk hydroplane sta
          tion they have an enviable record. There has not
          been a single accident to a plane, nor the loss of
          a plane In combat, where word of the occurrence.
          xviih not brought hack by the pigeons which are
          a part of the equipment of the planes. Instances
          of the value of the messengers could be multi
          plied without number, but It Is more Interesting
          to recount how these birds are bred, reared and
          housed under xvar conditions.
          The pigeon's ability to do all of these xvonderful
          tasks lies In Its faculty of orientation, that is, Its
          power to know as soon as It Is released In what
          direction Its homo loft Is and to fly directly to It.
          The perfection to which orientation is developed
          In the highly bred and trained homer was recently
          demonstrated at a pigeon fly conducted by the
          pigeon section of the signal corps, when 8,100
          homing pigeons were released In Washington for
          a My to New York city, '2'2 miles. To a single
          Mid, these pigeons ran out of their coops and
          arose In tho air with the speed of an express
          train, and after taking a half circle to get their
          bearing were ofT for Ncxv York. Every one of
          tho pigeons xvas reported to have arrived prompt
          ly nncl the llrst arrival tnado the trip In fi hours
          und -10 minutes. Surely It did not btop to read
          many sign posts on the xvuy.
          Just how the homing pigeon developed this
          poxver of orientation Is u moot question, hut It Is
          certain that It has been cultivated through cen
          turies uutll uow It Is almost uncanny. What
          guides the pigeon back to tho loft xvhere It first
          "took to the nlr" Is a quality called by many
          names, and you will flud that each person knows
          that ho has the answer to the riddle. Some call
          It lnnato love of home; others uttrlbutu It to fac
          ulty, atmospheric conditions, sight, or memory.
          Personally, 1 cannot call It anything moro or less
          than instinct, highly developed. Wo And it In
          lesser degree In horses, dogs mid cuts, and In
          other blrda It seems to bo developed n llttlo less
          nmrkodly, but with sufllclent nccuracy so thnt
          they migrate nunually thousands of mllen without
          tho nid of any other compass than their Instinct.
          When wo remember tho potent power of selec
          tion and think of the years and generations of
          careful breeding und selection which tho homing
          pigeon has undergone It is not to xvonderful thut
          they have developed the homing Instinct to u high
          degree. I have seen their cousins, the fan-tailed
          pigeons, bred to such n degriMj of fineness that
          they weighed only a fexv ounces apleco and were
          AJLVi. rfip&?f ryTo'PAcA'a'JAWf?

          so nervous that the.x could not stand still they
          were like the lialr-spilng of a xxateh. constantly
          preening and din-Mug an 1 on the mow. In very
          early times homing pigec us weie In xogite In
          Kgypt, fireeee and among the Udimmd-. Haclng
          pigeons has been n royal and national sport In
          llelgliini, France, ltal. Turkey. Kgypt and K'ig
          land for hundreds of years. It xxas Introduced
          Into this country In the ieventlus and has enjoyed
          a fair and steady growth until now there are
          three nntlonal homing pigeon associations with n
          membership of more than 'J.000 breeders.
          Much time Is spent In teaching the pigeon all of
          the trlekw which count when tho bird Is actually
          racing In competition svlth other pigeons. It is
          taught to enter I be loft Immediately upon Its re
          turn, for u bird 'hat does not enter so that tho
          message It carries can be taken from It Is of very
          little value as a messenger. Nothing Is moro
          exasperating to the fancier or racer than to have
          the pigeon return and cool Its anatomy and vloxv
          the scenery for a half hour before entering the
          loft. It Is nearly suf'iclent cause to make the
          trainer of pigeons lose his faith In pigeon nature j
          besides It gives the neighbors a chance to make
          remarks about the fullgrown men playing with
          birdies. Once the bird is Inside the loft It can
          not emerge, since each loft Is equipped xxlth n
          trap through which the bird can enter at any tlmo
          but cannot go out unless the trap Is set for exit.
          The ordinary bain variety of pigeon or those
          bred for the production of squabs for market and
          the racing homing pigeon should not be con
          fused. They are as dKtlnct and have as many
          points of difference as hiwo the big draft horse
          and the high-strung, nervous racing horse. The
          ordinary pigeon has xery little homing ability,
          whereas the homing plgaon Is kept and bred ex
          clusively for that faculty. They are also bred for
          speed, and every muscle which Is used In Might
          Is developed almost at tho expense of the other
          muscles of Its body. In races the actual speed
          recorded Is almost beyond belief. .Speeds of 1.8.ri0
          to 1,'.)00 yards per minute, or DO miles per hour,
          hnvo been madu for short distances, and It Is not
          extraordinary (or a bird to cover In excess of oOO
          miles In n single day. The record for 1,000 miles
          Is 1 day, 11 hours. LM minutes and 11 seconds, und
          xvas made by a bird named Ilullet, and the longest
          successful race was 1.0S0 miles from Denver,
          Colo., to Springfield, Mass. (tlmo I'l days, 3 hours,
          1!2 minutes), although Instances aro recorded
          xvhere birds sent from Noxv York to the I'uclMc
          const as breeders, have, on liberation or escape,
          returned from California, ox-or the mountains and
          plains to their old homes In New York.
          At various times In this country tho army and
          navy have decided to use use carrier pigeons in
          their work, but with lndl fferent success until tho
          recent xvur. The old reports aro rather amusing
          xvhen considered In tho light of present-day knowl
          edge of what can ho done with tho birds when
          handled properly. Pigeons were used In tho navy
          more than 20 years ngo, but failed through lack
          of proper care. At the tlmo of the Mexican bor
          der trouble pigeons xvero again tried, but with
          llttlo success for the saino reason and through
          lack of time for acclimatization.
          Homing pigeons were first put on a business
          llko basis In the army In Mnrch, 1017, In tho
          enstern department. In Nox-emher of that year
          tho pigeon section of the land division of tho sig
          nal corps was organized, and slnco then rapid
          progress has been mado in this country and
          abroad. Hundreds of
          lofts have been built and
          equipped In this country,
          and In the early days
          Uiiui.x pigeons xvero frldP
          pul oxei-seas. Men have
          been selected and trained
          In the science of pigeon
          'ireedln;:. rearing and Hy
          ing. Many of these huvo
          already found service
          overseas In the care of
          lofts and the birds of our
          armies. It has been nec
          essary to train a Inrtfo
          number of people in this
          worlc. as it was practi
          cally new to each person
          xvlni look It up. The
          training of olilcers und
          men In the use and care
          of th'; birds at the front
          and lb the forwarding of
          messages all took tlmo.
          Unfortunately the plR
          cons could only My "Vi
          could not tnlk, necessitat
          ing Mio xvrltlng of the
          messages. Some xvag 1ms
          proposed to Improve the
          pigeon by crossing It
          xxlth a parrot, thus ellra-
          of xvrltlng the messages.
          might have something to
          Minting the necessity
          However, the pigeon
          say about the matter.
          One of the most dllllcult parts of tho work of
          Introducing pigeons Into the army service was to
          Instill Into the minds of tho olilcers mid men the
          fact that the pigeons are reliable. That they aro
          reliable Is proved by the experience oversews,
          xvhere the birds nre retained in forward positions
          xvhlle any other method, whether telephone, tele
          graph, Induction buzzers, wireless, wlgxvag or run
          ner Is nvnllable, and only xvhen everything else
          falls, and only the birds remain, then through
          barrage, gas, and every other of the diabolical
          Inventions of xvar, mrrs ti.nn 07 per cent of tho
          messages Intrusted to our pigeons are safely and
          speedily delivered by them to headquarters.
          These messengers nre carried to tho front In
          especially constructed wicker baskets which can
          be carried handily by the soldier Intrusted xxlth
          their care. Hack of tho lines the pigeons are kept
          In either of txvo kinds of lofts or home, station
          ary or movable, but tho essentia! feature of each
          Is the same. Kvery effort Is made to meke eoch
          bird tfomfortnble, happy and attached to Its home.
          This 1h done most effectively by the method of
          feeding, ns tho uppionch to the bird's affection
          Is through Its stomach, the same ns with genus
          homo. Each loft Is equipped with n trap through
          which the birds ore taught to enter and leax-e
          xvlthout fear. Each time the bird enters the trap
          nn alarm is automatically rung, notifying the
          attendant of tho return of tho bird, that the mes
          sage may be Immediately obtained and forwarded
          to headquarters.
          Ilefore the late xvar If you bad told n pigeon
          fancier that you could move his pigeon loft as far
          as s"0 miles and thnt tho pigeons xvould return to It
          swiftly and accurately he would probably have
          laughed at you and snld something about your
          being u novice In the pigeon racing and breeding
          game. The movable loft Is one of tho ndvances
          In pigeon lore that the xvar has brought out.
          This Is a very Important development, ns It Is
          highly desirable that tho lofts always be near to
          military headquarters and available for instant
          removal with headquarters as conditions may re
          quire. These movablo lofts are very xvell con
          structed and nro Interesting homes for theso Itin
          erant messengers. They ure outfitted with nesting
          boxes, observation traps, storage space for feed,
          water, and accommodations for one or two at
          tendants xvho nre constantly on duty. In fact,
          they remind ono of tho circus wagons that travel
          with the smnllej; circuses about tho country.
          Another Innovation developed xvas the "oxvl ex
          press." There were pigeons nt tho front thnt
          developed tho fnculty for seeing nt night
          nnd theso xvero called veritable human night owls.
          In fact, they eumo home much moro steadily nnd
          accurately than some of their clvlllnn brethren,
          xvho xvero wont to bo habitual riders of tho "oxvl
          express."
          Tho sport of racing nnd breeding pigeons Is duo
          to receive nn Impetus as a civilian sport noxv thnt
          tho xvar Is ended, nnd tho progress made under
          xvar conditions should not bo nlloxved to lapse.
          Thousands, of soldiers xvlll hnvo become familiar
          with the birds and xvlll hnvo a warm regard for
          them. There xvlll bo many xvho xvlll Bhuro tho
          feeling of the oMlcer xvho xvns mentioned In tho
          Hint part of this nrtlclo ns having been saved by
          the pigeons In the hattlo of Dcthuncourt und
          Dead Man's hill.
